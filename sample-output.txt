      "transcript": "it took bitcoin 12 years to become a\ntrillion dollar network\nand there's nothing else bitcoin is\nworthless artificial gold\ni must say i bought some and it's my\nbest investment\nso i'm not uh bullish on bitcoin\nand bitcoin is the best money currently\navailable because it's decentralized it\ncannot be stopped\nthe main motivation is uh for the price\nto go up they don't use it they don't\ntransact in it\nthey just huddle it and and they're\nhoping they get rich\nand what's your response to that people\nnot using bitcoin\na few months ago i asked for your\nthoughts on bitcoin\nthe responses i received were exactly as\ni was expecting\nmost didn't understand it some of you\nlabelled it a scam\nand others praised it extensively saying\nit's going to be one of the biggest\nthings in the future\nor that it's going to make us question\nwhat exactly money and currency\nreally is you see i avoided looking into\nbitcoin for as long as i could\nbut there's only so many social media\nprofiles with laser eyes in them that\nyou can bear before you start to ask\nwhat exactly is going on here and the\nmore i tried to answer that question the\nmore intrigued i was by\nbitcoin and the ongoing saga it's become\ntake\nfor example the fact that it's creator\nan individual or a group of individuals\nunder the pseudonym satoshi nakamoto\nremains anonymous and unidentified to\nthis day\nand is said to own one million bitcoins\nwhich at the time of making this video\nmakes nakamoto worth over 62 billion\ndollars\ntheoretically should the price of a\nsingle bitcoin rise to 177 000\nnakamoto would be the richest person in\nthe world were they to sell their coins\nbut nakamoto is only one part of what\nmakes this ongoing saga so\nfascinating truth is it's a wild world\nout there and i think it's time that you\nand i finally take a step into the realm\nof crypto and begin to make sense of it\nall\n[Music]\nbitcoin is a story it's a story about\nthe very thing that influences\nour actions today the piece of paper\nthat we call money or the numbers you\nsee on a screen\nin your bank account but if you rewind\ntime far enough\nyou'll find that our ancestors purchased\ngoods using a method we wouldn't\nrecognize\ntoday payment first began with barter\na system which involved trading goods\nfor other goods\na few fish for a loaf of bread a dozen\neggs for a bunch of\nlettuce and so on but this system had a\nproblem it relied on us\nwanting what the other person had it\nrelied on a coincidence of\nwants so our ancestors realized that we\nneeded a medium of exchange\nto represent the value of the items they\nwanted to buy\nsuch as cattle shells and eventually\ncoins made of precious metals\nthen thousands of years later countries\nstarted using\npaper money that was backed by gold in\nother words the dollar would be backed\nby a certain amount of gold and you\ncould\ntheoretically exchange those dollars for\nphysical gold that a country held in its\nreserves\nthis system was known as the gold\nstandard\nin 1971 however the us officially left\nthe gold standard along with many other\ncountries\nthis meant that the dollar was no longer\nbacked up by gold the dollar was simply\nbacked up on the basis that the\ngovernment decreed that it had\nvalue and we all agreed that it does\ndoing this\nallowed governments and central banks to\nhave more control over our money supply\nmaking it easier to use monetary policy\nto respond to times of financial crisis\nthis type of money the money that we use\ntoday which is no longer backed up by\ngold\nbut rather our faith in government is\nknown as fiat money now there exists\nboth arguments\nfor and against fiat money but the\nimportant thing to realize here is that\nthis system\nrelies on trust in government but what\nif you don't\nhave that trust who do you turn to then\nemerging in the late 1980s the\ncypherpunks were part of a movement that\nwas against\ncentralized authorities like governments\nbeing able to spy on people or have\naccess to their information\nthey advocated for what is known as\ncryptography ways in which we're able to\nsecure communication in the presence of\nthird parties\ntypically through the use of encryption\nwith their libertarian views\nthe cypherpunks saw a clear\ncontradiction between their values and\nthe current financial system when they\nlooked at banks\nor central banks they saw centralized\ninstitutions with the power to print as\nmuch money as they wanted on their terms\nwe the people trust our banking\ninstitutions to be a safe place to put\nour money that they won't mismanage it\nand\nultimately collapse cypherpunks did not\nlehman brothers is going bankrupt and\nfinancial markets from asia to europe\nare doing their utmost to prevent monday\nfrom turning from dark\nto black brought down by bad mortgage\ninvestments lehman which has\n25 000 employees will be liquidated the\namerican people\ncan remain confident in the soundness\nand the resilience of our financial\nsystem\nmajor financial institutions have\nteetered on the edge of collapse\nand some have failed we are in the midst\nof a serious\nfinancial crisis in 2007 and 2008\na global financial crisis was unfolding\na crisis that had its roots in risky\nlending from banks\nso much so that it led to the collapse\nof one of the united states biggest\nbanks at the time\nlehman brothers it was perhaps no\ncoincidence then that under the shadow\nof the 2008 financial crisis\na white paper titled bitcoin a\npeer-to-peer electronic cash system\nbegan to circulate on a cryptography\nmailing list a paper that was written by\nsomeone under the pseudonym of satoshi\nnakamoto this nine-page manifesto was a\nblueprint for what nakamoto described as\na purely peer-to-peer version of\nelectronic cash which would allow\npayments to be sent directly from one\nparty\nto another without going through a\nfinancial institution\nnakamoto took the technological\ninnovations of former cypherpunks\nand put them together into what we now\ncall blockchain technology\nto put it simply nakamoto laid out a\nframework\nusing mathematics computer science and\ncryptography\nto create a currency that could be used\nfor transactions without needing to\ntrust\na central authority trust was the\nproblem\nbitcoin was set out to solve now let's\npause for a moment\nhere is where things can get a little\nconfusing whilst we've covered the\nmotivations behind bitcoin\nnow we must figure out what exactly is\nit and how is it decentralized\nunderstanding blockchain technology is\nthe key to understanding the fanaticism\naround bitcoin that we see\ntoday bitcoin is not a physical coin\nit is in fact entirely virtual a digital\ncurrency\nthink of bitcoin as simply transactions\non a ledger\nfor example let's say ben pays two\nbitcoins to\njane and jane pays two bitcoins to carl\nthese transactions are recorded on a\nledger and so on and so forth for every\ntransaction that comes after\nbanks work in a similar way recording\nthe transactions made through a bank\naccount each and every day\nusing their own system verifying that\nthe transactions made are in fact valid\nin other words a bank can make sure that\nsomebody with only a hundred dollars in\ntheir account cannot spend any more than\nthat bitcoin\nhowever is intended to be decentralized\nso how could it possibly\nverify that the transactions made on its\nledger are legitimate\nthat ben even has two bitcoins to send\nto jain in the first place\nthis is where we introduced the concept\nof a peer-to-peer or distributed ledger\nsystem that nakamoto outlined in his\nwhite paper\ninstead of a central authority owning\nthe ledger that records all bitcoin\ntransactions\nthe ledger is instead distributed\namongst all the other computers\nor nodes in the bitcoin network a\nnetwork that anyone with a computer can\njoin simply by downloading the bitcoin\nsoftware\nnow each time a transaction is made on\nthe ledger every computer on the network\nwill attempt to verify\nwhether this transaction is legitimate\nby solving complex algorithms when a\nconsensus is reached on the network and\nthe transaction is valid it will be\npermanently stored on the ledger if a\nsingle node on the network attempts to\nvalidate an incorrect transaction\nall the other nodes on the network will\nreject it and after a certain amount of\ntransactions are made on the ledger a\nnew ledger is created that contains a\ntype of code\notherwise called a hash that links back\nto the previous ledger this is why we\ncall it a blockchain\neach of these ledgers or blocks contain\na certain amount of transactions\nthat are then linked to the previous\nblock in the chain and no public\nidentities\nare used when transacting on the bitcoin\nblockchain instead\nindividuals have both a public and a\nprivate key which appear as a string of\nrandom numbers and letters\na private key is used to create a\ndigital signature\nand a public key is used to verify the\nsignature without revealing the private\nkey\nthis process of validating transactions\non the block is known as mining\nminers receive a reward of a few\nbitcoins for every block they\nsuccessfully mine\nincentivizing them to continue adding to\nthe blockchain if someone attempts to\nhack or invalidate a previous block on\nthe blockchain they would end up\ninvalidating every single block that\ncomes after it which would be easy to\ndetect\nand reject by the network the bitcoin\nblockchain allows you to see\nevery single transaction that has ever\nbeen made since the very first block\nwithout being able to alter or change\nthe records in other words\nit's a decentralized form of currency\nthat doesn't rely\non trust between parties for\ntransactions to occur you can still find\nthe very first block on the bitcoin\nblockchain today\nmined by the mysterious satoshi nakamoto\nin 2009\nshowing that nakamoto was given a total\nof 50 bitcoins as a reward for mining\nthe first block\nthis block is commonly referred to as\nthe genesis block\nnakamoto had also set the supply limit\nfor bitcoins as 21 million within the\nsoftware code itself\nas of today there are only two million\nbitcoins left\nto mine now admittedly all of this can\nseem very confusing at the start\nand it's very difficult to explain all\nof this inside of one video like we're\ntrying to do now there are however many\nother resources that you can use to\nlearn about bitcoin and blockchain\ntechnology one of which\nis skillshare who are kindly sponsoring\nthis video if you haven't heard of them\nalready skillshare is an online\ncommunity with amazing classes\nat the moment skillshare has a\ndemystifying cryptocurrency\nunderstanding bitcoin and beyond class\nby milton demiros\nwho does a brilliant job of

could\ndigital currency with albeit brilliant\ntechnology\ntruly be worth more than 60 thousand\ndollars\nprice is a matter of demand so how did\nthe demand\never reach this point in the first place\nin early 2009\nafter releasing their infamous white\npaper nakamoto\nmined the genesis block setting into\nmotion a series of events that would\nchange its future forever\nthe early adopters of bitcoin included\nthose from the cypherpunk movement\nand others who mined bitcoin just as a\nhobby\nuntil 2010 bitcoin was worth practically\nnothing yet that would soon change\nthat year during the month of may a man\nnamed lazlo honyats\ncreated a post on a bitcoin discussion\nforum offering to pay 10 000 bitcoins\nfor two large pizzas\ntwo days later laszlo reported that he\nhad successfully traded his bitcoin for\n25 dollars worth of pizza this was the\nvery first recorded transaction in which\nbitcoin was used to purchase a tangible\nitem and just like that the digital\ncurrency\ntook its first big step in becoming\nrecognized as having value\nthe 22nd of may was officially dubbed\nbitcoin pizza day\nby the end of 2010 bitcoin had gone from\nbeing worth nothing\nto 39 cents and the very first bitcoin\nexchange\nmount gox was set up making it easier\nfor people to trade their bitcoins with\nregular currencies\nin 2011 bitcoin reached a price of one\ndollar\nand suddenly we began seeing the\nemergence of other cryptocurrencies\nusing the very same blockchain\ntechnology that bitcoin uses\nthese alternative cryptocurrencies\notherwise known as altcoins\naim to solve their own problems by\nmaking changes to the original bitcoin\nwhilst bitcoin's intentions are to be a\ndigital currency\na cryptocurrency like ethereum is\nattempting to do something entirely\ndifferent using blockchain technology\nboth of which require their own research\nand looking into there are currently\nthousands of altcoins out there and some\nof which are ponzi or pump and dumb\nschemes that serve\nno use purpose bitcoin did however\nstruggle in its early years from a poor\nreputation and multiple scandals\nits use of a private and a public key\nsystem allowed for a level of anonymity\nwhich made it perfect for criminals and\nillegal use purposes\nsilk road was a notorious website on the\ndark web which engaged in the buying and\nselling of illegal substances with which\nbitcoins were used for transactions\nthe website itself was a sophisticated\nendeavor that proved tough to crack\nit used the online currency bitcoins and\noperated in the so-called\ndeep web because of this the association\nof bitcoin with black markets like silk\nroad\nput a stain on its reputation that can\nstill be felt today\nanother significant scandal during these\nyears was the collapse of mount gox\nbitcoin's first and biggest exchange\nwhich at one point\nhandled up to 70 percent of all bitcoin\ntransactions\nheard of an online currency exchange\nknown as mount gox\nhis website had been one of the largest\nonline exchanges\nfor the digital cryptocurrency known as\nbitcoins the site went offline tuesday\namid allegations of major theft\nand carpals acknowledged today he can't\naccount for 850\n000 bitcoins mount gox unexpectedly\nshut down today owing hundreds of\nmillions of pounds\nwhat was once one of the world's biggest\nbitcoin exchanges mount gox has filed\nfor bankruptcy protection in japan\nbut even during bitcoin's worst days the\ndemand still remained\nwith the launch of companies like bitpay\nwhich provided mobile transactions for\nbusinesses\nwanting to accept bitcoin the\nspeculation around the cryptocurrency\nreached new heights in 2013 bitcoin\nreached 1 000\nat its peak before dropping into the\nhundreds it was in 2017 however\nwhen bitcoin faced its most unbelievable\nyear yet\nin japan that very year a law was passed\nthat accepted bitcoin as the legal\npayment method\nthe hype and speculation continue to\nmount as headline after headline\nreported bitcoin\nreaching all-time highs it's during\nthese moments of a bubble where suddenly\neveryone you ever knew is talking about\nbitcoin\nthe market was getting greedy and\nirrational there were companies simply\nadding blockchain to their name and\nseeing\ntheir share prices surged 394\nat the peak of it all in december of\n2017\na single bitcoin was worth almost 20 000\nbut just as fast as the hype and\nspeculation had come\nit had also burst\nif you think the dow had a bad day\nbitcoins was worse the price is now\nhaving around seven\nthousand dollars a jaw-dropping loss of\nnearly 15 percent just check the members\nyeah 15\nover the course within days after\nhitting its peak bitcoin began to tumble\nback down in price\nspurred on partly because of government\ncrackdowns as cryptocurrency exchanges\nwere banned in china\nthe fear of missing out swiftly became\nthe fear of losing money\nand the price of cryptocurrencies\ncollapsed 80 since its peak\nmaking the 2018 cryptocurrency crash\nworse than the dot-com crash\ni mean i bought bitcoin when it was\ntwenty thousand dollars\nand i literally put three hundred\nthousand dollars in there\nthat 300 was like literally my life\nsavings\nyou know by december of that year\nbitcoin had fallen to just over 3\n200 and yet despite the crash\nbitcoin's worth remained in the\nthousands and now\nonly three years after the 2018 crash\nbitcoin is worth over 60 000\nat the time of recording why\nwhat separates a retail investor from an\ninstitutional investor\nfor one it's money a lot of money\nit's for that reason then that the\nrecent institutional\ninterest in bitcoin is what is fueling\nthe current insanity that we see today\nthis morning from paypal the company's\nvenmo app will now allow its 70 million\ncustomers to buy hold and sell\ncryptocurrency now the rollout begins\ntoday and it's going to be available to\nall customers in the next few weeks\nelon musk does it again a shock\nannouncement and an immediate market\nresponse\ntesla has put one and a half billion\ndollars into bitcoin\nand musk will accept bitcoin as payment\nand as the us federal reserve continues\nprinting money in order to boost the\neconomy under the current circumstances\nthe fear of rising inflation grows\nstronger\nand stronger you see the narrative\naround bitcoin\nhas changed whereas in its initial white\npaper bitcoin was intended to be a\ncurrency\nmore and more investors are looking at\nbitcoin as a store of value instead\nwe'll dive deeper into this pivot during\nthe next part of this series but it's\nimportant to acknowledge that\ninstitutional\ninterest in bitcoin was something it was\npreviously lacking\nbitcoin ultimately has to rely on\npeople's belief in its ability to be a\ncurrency\nor as we now see it being used as a\nstore of value\nand yet there are those who say that\nbitcoin is not worth\nits current price or those that think\nits price is being manipulated\nto a great extent the price of bitcoin\nis totally manipulated by bunch of\npeople\nby a bunch of ways i think the whole\ndamn development is disgusting\nformer paypal ceo bill harris called the\ncryptocurrency quote\nthe greatest scam in history noting that\nit is a pump and dump scheme\ni could care less with bitcoin trades\nfor how it trades wiretrace who trades\nit if you're stupid enough to buy you'll\npay the price for it one day\nthe next part of this series will be\ncoming shortly as we take a dive into\nthe heated\ndebate and speculation around bitcoin\ntoday the link for that will be in the\ndescription when it's out but i would\nabsolutely recommend you learn about\nbitcoin and blockchain technology\nyourself especially if you're going to\nbe investing in it

to\nsee\na criticism of their business practices\nand promoted\nideologies not an incitement of\nharassment or hate\ni have no way of knowing their true\nintentions\nit is entirely possible that those\nmentioned have created their teachings\nwith good intent\nno matter how misguided those teachings\nhave become and whilst i will be\nincluding sources to back up every claim\nthat i make\ntreat

money\nyou have misunderstood my position one\nlook at my channel will show you\ni have no problem with somebody making\nmoney\nhowever i do take issue with the context\nsurrounding how they make their money a\nlot of people actually were in my group\nwere attending the events the courses\nyou know hope to make money so that they\ncould feed the family but\nyou know unfortunately i've lost it new\nage spirituality has seen\nincredible growth in the mainstream\nhaving a huge\ninfluence on the self-help industry\nthanks to figures like napoleon hill\nrhonda byrne and others who i will be\ndiscussing further but what seemingly\ngoes\nunnoticed is the booming business behind\nit that i think\ndoes more harm than good when you\nrecognize your vibrational frequency\nyou're drawing into yourself all the\ntime\nliterally the vibration that is most\nlike what you're\nputting out right there was a woman who\nhad cancer\nwho refused medical treatment because\nshe believed in the secret in this video\nwe'll take a look at some of its most\ninfluential figures its roots and how it\nis fundamentally\nbuilt from a flawed and dangerous\ndisregard for reality\nnow it would be impossible for me to\ncover the entirety of the new thought\nmovement\nin just one video so bear in mind that\nthere will be influential figures in\nthis industry that i fail to mention or\ndecide\nto cut however i want you to take notice\nof the patterns\nfrom multi-level marketing to scammers\nto self-help to pseudoscience\nto subtle deception i'll aim to\ndemonstrate why i think\nnew age spirituality has inherently\nallowed itself to become\nthe perfect grift\n[Music]\nhey how's everybody doing today me too\nall right here's what i want to talk\nabout today working in an office\nit's

could\nbring you health\nwealth and happiness that idea was the\nlaw\nof attraction everything that's coming\ninto your life you are attracting into\nyour life\nand it's attracted to you by virtue of\nthe images you're holding in your mind\na film that suggested being overweight\ncame from thinking\nfat thoughts or that the only reason a\nperson does not have enough money\nis because they are blocking money from\ncoming to them with their own\nthoughts the secret is the law of\nattraction it was a feel-good\nmessage the film exceeded 65 million\ndollars in sales\nand became something of a cultural\nphenomenon have you heard about it\nthis is the secret talk about this dvd\nhas been spreading\naround the world i i had friends that\nwere telling me\nthat the secret is real girl i knew sent\nme a book\n[Music]\ncalled the secret she was like listen\ndavid this is gonna help these\nbut what you are also witnessing here is\nthe success\nof another kind a success at rebranding\nan idea

desperate\ncritical thinking is dull and feeling an\nemotion\ncloud your decision-making abilities so\nwhen you're presented this\nsecret a secret that promises to change\nyour life with so little effort\nwho could possibly fault you for wanting\nto believe\nthe bait has been set but you have to\nunderstand\nthe law of attraction is only one branch\nof a bigger\nbelief system to understand the problems\nwith the ideas ronda presented\nyou have to examine the roots of where\nit all began\nfrom here you can trace the same\npatterns and the influence it's having\nover the gurus we see\ntoday\nthe new thought movement was centered\naround a few\nkey ideas that we and everything in\nexistence\nare essentially god or at least we all\nhave some level of divinity within us\npositive thinking has the power to carry\nforth manifestations into the material\nworld\nnew thoughts supposed origins travel\nback to a man named phineas parkhurst\nquimby\nan american clockmaker born in 1802.\nquimby became interested in the idea of\nusing the mind as a way of curing people\nfrom illness and disease\nafter he himself had supposedly\nrecovered from tuberculosis\nthrough his own healing methods his\nphilosophy became the basis for new\nthought\nquimby's teachings inspired many other\nauthors\nand so-called philosophers to continue\nspreading and expanding on his message\nand the overall new thoughts movement in\nthose years\nnew thoughts focused on our mind's\nability to heal us from illness and\ndisease\nit emphasized intuition feeling and\nanecdotal evidence\nrather than empirical science-based\nevidence\nit wasn't however until the 20th century\nwhere the new thought movement\nextrapolated this into wealth creation\nthe ideology is perfect if our thoughts\nhad the power to quite\nliterally change the material world\nsurely they could manifest wealth\ntoo then a man named napoleon hill\ncame right out of the blue with his\nfirst book the law of success\nand a decade later his best-selling book\nthink and grow rich\nup to this point it's nigh impossible to\ntell what the intentions of most new\nthought authors were\nthe ideas they presented in their works\nwere logically flawed in many\nareas some of which i have already\ndiscussed in the first installment of\nthis series\nothers of which we will get into soon\nbut it's when we get to figures like\nnapoleon hill that the lines between\ngood intentions\nand con artistry are blurred because\nhill had an\nimmense influence over many of the new\nthought law of attraction gurus that\nhave come\nsince having had his works promoted and\ncirculated\nin countless business and self-help\ncircles i promise you\nif you yourself haven't heard of this\nbook you know someone who has\nbut my question to you now is how much\ndo you really know\nabout napoleon hill because if we take a\ndive into hill's past\nwe notice that the reputation he's\nacquired amongst the new thought\nmovement\nis not at all what it seems on the\ncontrary his true narrative is one of\nfailed businesses\nfraud and grossly exaggerated\nachievements\nthink and grow rich echoes much of the\nnew thought sentiment\nespecially when it comes to the pursuit\nof riches highlighting how\nour thoughts and our desires can be\ntransmuted into their financial\nequivalent\nhill even goes as far as to use examples\nin which\nthoughts have been able to cure deafness\nincluding his own sons\nthis is a book that napoleon claims he\nwas tasked with creating\nafter meeting one of the richest men in\nthe world at the time\nandrew carnegie whereby carnegie tasked\nhim to interview some of the most\nsuccessful men in business\nand learn the secrets to their success\nbut go\na little further down that rabbit hole\nand you'll realize\nhill may not be the person he is so\ncommonly portrayed as by his fans\nor his own works in 1907\n30 years before the release of think and\ngrow rich hill co-founded the acree hill\nlumber company in mobile alabama only a\nyear later\nthe pensacola journal reported that the\ncompany was liable to bankruptcy\nproceedings and charges of mail fraud\nit turns out that hill had bought lumber\nfrom outside of mobile on credit\nbefore selling the lumber at a much\nlower price in cash\neventually creditors and other\nbusinesses were catching wind of the\nfraud and in september of 1908\nhill was on the run from authorities it\nwas around this time that napoleon hill\nclaimed he spoke with andrew carnegie\nbut\naccording to andrew carnegie's\nbiographer there was quote\nno evidence of any sort that carnegie\nand hill\never met in 1909 hill initiated the\nautomobile college of washington\na college that promised students to\nteach them how to build\nshaw fur and sell motor cars only it\nturns out this college\nwas just a way of getting free labor for\nbuilding cars and then selling them\nthe motorworld magazine in april 1912\ncalled hills college a scam and a quote\njoked to anyone of average intelligence\nlisting the many insane claims that\nhills college had been making\nalong with its scheme of paying students\nthree dollars ahead per any other\nstudent they had recruited into the\ncollege\nmuch akin to a multi-level marketing\nscheme we might see today\nthe college eventually folded in 1912\nbut hill wasn't finished trying to make\na name for himself\nand in 1915 he established a school\ncalled\nthe george washington institute of\nadvertising intending to teach the\nprinciples of success and\nself-confidence\nonly three years later two warrants had\nbeen issued for the arrest of hill with\ncharges of violating blue sky laws\nyou see hill established the college\nwith a 100 000\ncapitalization and attempted to sell the\nshares to investors\nprimarily his own students despite the\nschool's assets being worth at best\ntwelve hundred dollars the school ended\nnot long afterwards\nand this only scratches the surface of\nthe other swindles hill had been\ninvolved in\nof course i understand what the common\nrebuke here would be\nnapoleon hill's book actually has value\nand i myself have taken value from that\nbook\nwhy should i care if the man himself had\na fraudulent past\nbut that's the point isn't it if you\nwere\na grifter then for the grift to work you\nmust be able to provide\nsome crumb of truth the strategy is\nsimple yet so effective\ngain the trust of your victim by\npreaching some level of truth\nthen subtly attach more extreme ideas to\nthat truth\nuntil the victim can no longer recognize\nthe difference\nnew thought does this constantly\npositive thinking\nis no longer just a tool solely for\nbetter day-to-day well-being\nit becomes a powerful force that can\nliterally manifest material results\nhealth and disease according to new\nthoughts can be cured\nsimply through the power of our minds\nconsider this\nhow many people have read and engrossed\nthemselves in the teachings of napoleon\nhill\nhundreds if not millions of individuals\nbut how many of them\ntruly managed to achieve the financial\nsuccess that they initially visualized\non being tasked to do so when reading\nthe book\nmost i'd wager have likely not why is\nthat\nbecause financial success can't possibly\nbe reduced down to your thinking\nor your ability to visualize wealth even\ntaking action\nwhich hill admittedly does promote in\nhis book is no guarantee for financial\nsuccess\naction increases probabilities but for\nthis to be a law\nit must work every time and yet new\nthought is fundamentally\nunfalsifiable we can't measure thoughts\nand feelings\nnor the supposed vibrations thoughts and\nfeelings have\nand that's just the thing see the best\ngrift is the one that leaves the grifter\nblameless anyone right now can write a\nbook or sell a program\non the law of attraction they can run\nads targeting vulnerable consumers\nand best of all if their teachings don't\nwork the blame\nnever falls on them it's always your\nfault\nyou didn't believe enough you weren't\nthinking positive enough you had\nresistance you weren't patient enough\nnow the price of a book\ndoesn't seem daunting if you only spend\na few dollars and glean some value from\nit then it seems rather harmless\nand possibly worth the money but how\nwould you feel if the price of said book\nwas a figure much higher than just\na few dollars how would you feel about\nsomeone promoting a\nsecret or guarantee of success for much\nlarger amounts of money\nnapoleon hill's book has been an\ninspiration to many\nas the new thought movement continues to\ngrow inspiring much of the self-help\nindustry we're consumed by today\ntwo of which went by the names of jerry\nand esther\nhicks we'd like to ask abraham to come\nand speak to us okay\nit just takes a few seconds\nit is nice to have an opportunity to\nvisit\n[Music]\nesther hicks claims that she can channel\nan entity or rather a group of entities\nknown as abraham hicks charging hundreds\nof dollars for their seminars and\nworkshops\ngood morning\nmembers of the audience are invited\nforward to pose a question to esther\nor more specifically the abraham entity\nshe is supposedly\nchanneling hi it's nice to see you again\nthank you again\nand thank you to esther\nwhilst jerry sits at the side somewhere\ntaking notes\nperhaps for their next book we want to\nsay that in this\nbook that is coming there are 33\nexamples of all kinds of things that\nmight happen in someone's life\nand each of these exams both esther and\njerry have authored countless books\npromoting the teachings of this abraham\nentity\nwhich are structured like a conversation\nbetween jerry and abraham\nwith the latter giving answers to life's\nmost asked questions\nesther goes as far as claiming on her\nsite that this is the original source\nmaterial\nfor the current law of attraction in\nfact\nmany in the law of attraction community\nsuggests that ronda burns film\nthe secret was just a watered-down\nversion of hicks's teachings\nand it's precisely because of esther's\nreputation as the\nmost authentic one out of the two that i\nthink it's worth discussing her\nbecause upon closer inspection we see\nthat much of hicks's teachings\nare exactly what we've come to\nunderstand from new thought\ni don't actually have to know whether or\nnot esther really is channeling an\nentity for me to be extremely skeptical\nof her work\nthe contradictions and problematic\nteachings speak far more to her\nlegitimacy\nthan any claims of channeling in\nesther's book\nthe law of attraction one such\nproblematic teaching\ncenters around the idea that a victim of\na robbery is a co-creator of the\nviolence inflicted upon them\njerry states i can understand robbers\nbeing attracted to those they're robbing\nbut it's difficult to see\ninnocent victims attracting the robbery\nor the person being discriminated\nagainst attracting the prejudice\nhicks responds they are just the same\nthe assaulted\nand the assaulter are co-creators of the\nevent\nif you think hicks's response here is a\none-off\nyou'd be mistaken she emphasizes this\npoint\nnumerous times take a moment to truly\nconsider\nthe level of victim blaming and lack of\naccountability\nthat such a position would lead to or\ninstead of a robbery\nimagine a child born into poverty who\nstarves to death\nbefore the age of five according to\nhicks's teachings\nthese children were co-creators of their\nfate\nand this isn't a belief shared just by\nhicks alone\nthis is a fundamental premise in all of\nnew thoughts\nby this logic we can say that the\nperpetrators of countless crimes\nshouldn't be held accountable\nafter all they are just the product of\ntheir victim's vibrational frequency\nany rational person can see the danger\nof this thinking\nbut as we've come to learn for the\npreacher of such ideas\nthis logic is perfect because all who\ncomplain that they haven't been able to\nmanifest health\nwealth abundance or whatever dream we've\nsold them on\nwe can tell these people that it isn't\nthe fault of our belief system that they\ndidn't get what they wanted\nit is in fact their fault and as we\npedal more of our workshops write more\nof our books\nwe have an excuse each and every time\nsomeone attempts to challenge our ideas\nso\nwhat we notice as we look into the\nmedical profession today\nwe see doctors and scientists literally\nscaring\npeople to death with their\npronouncements of diseases that are\nincurable\nwhen we know that there is not any\ndisease that is incurable\nyou can get to where you want to be from\nwherever you are\nif you will point in the direction that\nyou want to go and continue to move in\nthat direction\nesther hicks as we've already discovered\nwith others in the new thought movement\nmakes the claim that our thoughts and\nfeelings or our vibrational frequencies\ncan cure us of any disease\nit seems odd then or rather hypocritical\nthat her husband\njerry himself passed away from cancer in\n2011\nbut this hypocrisy is something we'll\nsee more of as we continue\nnow you might ask why bother adding all\nthe metaphysical and pseudo-scientific\nideas in the first place\nif esther and jerry were truly trying to\ncon people or just make a ton of money\nwouldn't it have appealed to a bigger\nmarket if she simply passed herself\noff as a life coach rather than turning\npotential customers off of her works by\nclaiming that she could\nchannel another entity i however\ndisagree it's my opinion that the\naddition of spirituality and channeling\nis actually an incredibly clever\nmarketing device\nbecause now life advice turns into\nthe teachings of abraham and if one\nwants to hear the teachings of abraham\nthey must go to the source they must go\nto the person who is claiming to channel\nthis divine entity\nthis creates scarcity around hicks's\nbusiness of answering humanity's burning\nquestions\nand the scarce of the product the more\nvaluable it becomes\nso when you're given an eye-watering\nprice tag no one bats an eyelid\nit is my opinion that new thoughts use\nof spirituality and pseudoscience\nserves this exact purpose allowing your\nteachings to seem more valuable in the\nmarketplace\nit is my opinion that the use of an\nabraham entity is more of a marketing\ndevice than anything else\nconceived from the foundation of jerry\nhicks's past career\nas a high-level distributor for the\nmulti-level marketing company\namway a company that preached ideas like\nthe law of attraction\nand books like napoleon hills think and\ngrow rich because they recognized that\nin order to keep members inside the mlm\nscheme\nthey had to blame themselves if they\ndidn't achieve the goals the mlm\npromised\neither way none of this stopped oprah\nfrom inviting esther for an interview\nyears later\njust as she had done with ronda burns\nand that for over 20 years\nesther hicks and her husband jerry have\nbeen spreading the word of that\nso-called secret\nit didn't stop the abraham hicks\nmoney-making machine from running as\nusual\nthe secret just like esther and jerry's\nworks well repackaged ideas from the\nsame route\nnew thought it was perfect to promise\nyou\nhealth wealth love and abundance all in\none go\nto package it all under an umbrella of\nspirituality\nbelieve that once you discover the\nsecret\nthat you can immediately start creating\nthe life you want\nwhether it's getting out of debt whether\nit's finding a more fulfilling job\neven falling in love ronda's film earned\nher millions\nand it gave an incredible boost to the\ncareers of the supposed teachers it\nfeatured\nallowing them to branch away from the\nfranchise to run their own coaching\nbusinesses\nand cash in on spiritual retreats but i\nremind you\nnew thoughts is a belief system\nperfectly designed for grifters who\ndon't care for the desperately ill\npoor and helpless who line their pockets\nleading them to push\nincredibly dangerous ideas onto their\nvictims\nso what if i just visualize checks\ncoming in the mail so i'll just\nvisualize\na bunch of checks coming in tomorrow\nwithin just one month\nthings start to change and it's amazing\ntoday i just get\nchecks in the mail i get a few bills but\ni get more checks than bills\nbut now serious

you lose in your\nexperience\nall in all the cost of ten thousand\npounds\ni know it's a sick\nand as a single parent that's got to be\ndevastating um devastating\nis a bit of an understatement\nwhat is the law of attraction or new\nthought when you realize that positive\nthinking\nvisualizations meditation affirmations\nare all\ntools that exist separately from this\nbelief system\nwhen we strip away all these tools from\nnew thought then perhaps you'll see it\nin a truer light\nan unhealthy glorification of positivity\nwith a lack of care for real science\nopting instead for anecdotes and\nunfalsifiable claims\nof course science isn't able to explain\neverything yet\nthe problem of consciousness is a real\none but when i look at new thoughts or\nnew age spirituality in general\nit doesn't seem truly interested in\nthese ideas\nit instead uses spirituality to promote\ngreat dreams and a feel-good message\nthat dumbs down complicated issues like\nobtaining wealth\nor disease into metaphysical\npseudo-scientific\nconcepts it uses spirituality to avoid\nharsher realities about the world at\nlarge it is guilty of the just world\nfallacy\nassuming that positive actions will lead\nto positive consequences\ncompletely ignoring the fact that\nsometimes those who are optimistic\nand positive all their lives can be run\ndown and taken advantage of\nwhilst other individuals who are morally\nbankrupt advance successfully in their\ncareers with no repercussions\nit's easy to fall into new thoughts\noverly optimistic and naive painting of\nreality\ni know this because i myself have done\nso in a video on this very channel i\npromoted the works of eckhart tolle\nand although tolle's books steer more\ntowards eastern and taoist philosophy\ni didn't realize that what i was\npromoting was still a gateway into new\nthought\nmy message here is not that you should\nabandon your goals visions or dreams\nbut that you should be wary of an\nindustry that uses\nunfalsifiable claims and an unimaginable\namount of pseudoscience to generate\nmillions in revenue critical thinking is\na skill and it should be\nhoned and practiced from looking at the\nnew thought movement's tendency to\nattract those who have\nquestionable intentions to its\nincredibly harmful claims about health\nand medicine\nand its constant habit of victim blaming\nit should be met with extreme scrutiny\nand a series like this isn't going to\nstop this ever-growing industry\nbut my hope is that it gets you to see\nanother side to this belief system\nwhether you yourself believe in it or\nwhether you know someone who does\nbecause at some point i'm certain you\nwill encounter\nnew thoughts or new age spirituality\nwhether it be on the train home from\nwork\nwhilst talking to a friend or scrolling\nthrough your social media feed\nif this series gets you to do anything\nin that moment\nit's this to stop and think critically\nno matter how vulnerable your situation\nto not let someone bypass your reason\nand logic\nto be able to spot when someone is\npromising you a dream\nto spot when someone is presenting you a\ncrumb of truth so that you accept their\nlarger more extreme

promotion of the idea\nwith celebrities promoting it\nentire careers based around teaching it\nsurely there's merit\nto the law of attraction but the further\nyou go down that rabbit hole\nthe less innocent things become i i had\nfriends\nthat were telling me that the secret is\nreal law of attraction\nmanifestation how to effectively\nmanifest\nyour dream life\nit's an idea heavily promoted by\nself-help communities\nan idea that some become completely\nidentified with\nthe law of attraction is no longer a\nfringe concept\nit very much has successfully\ninfiltrated the mainstream\nin this two-part series i'll be\ninvestigating the law of attraction\nas both an idea and the profitable\nindustry behind it\nbecause what begins as an innocent idea\nthat most can get behind\nquickly turns into a tool for\ngaslighting cult\nand material harm\n[Music]\nthis video was helped made possible by\nour sponsor\ntrends which to those of you who are\ninterested in entrepreneurship\nrunning

back into the video\nit's important that before we fully\nbegin to understand the problems with\nthe law of attraction\nwe understand what its fundamental\nclaims and beliefs are\nand so allow me to give you an overview\nas unbiased as i can possibly be\neverything in the universe is energy\nmoving and vibrating on their own\nfrequencies\nand so too are our thoughts and feelings\nwhatever frequency your thoughts and\nfeelings are vibrating at\nyou will attract that of which is\nvibrating on the same frequency\njust like tuning into a radio station\nwhere when tuned to a certain frequency\nwe can hear only the songs that are\nbeing played on that frequency\nyour life is much the same when you set\nyour intentions into the universe and\nyou begin to think\nand feel on the same vibrations as that\nof which you desire it is that of which\nvibrates on the same frequency that you\nwill attract and manifest\ninto your life whether it's wealth\nhappiness or relationships it is by\nthinking\nand feeling as though these things are\nalready yours that you will begin\nattracting these things into your life\nyou've done it yourself remember those\nmoments where you had a goal\nor set intention in mind and seemingly\nout of nowhere the right person appeared\nat the right time and place that helped\nyou inch closer to or achieve that goal\nwhen things just seemingly aligned in\nthe universe where random occurrences\nlike\nmeeting your best friend by chance\ncouldn't just be explained by luck alone\nthe truth is you manifested these things\ninto your life\nisn't that a powerful thing to know that\nby aligning your thoughts and feelings\nto that of which you want\nyou can manifest and make those things a\nreality and just as positive thoughts\nand feelings attract positive\nmanifestations towards you\nso too will negative thoughts and\nfeelings when your predominant thoughts\nand feelings are of debt relationship\nissues and negativity you will attract\nthose things into your life\nthe truth is that you can change your\nreality by changing your thoughts and\nfeelings\nthe world is abundant abundant with joy\nlove and peace align your thinking and\nyour feeling\nwith that abundance leave the clutches\nof scarcity thinking\nand your life too will be filled with\n[Music]\nabundance\n[Music]\nbefore we tackle this idea and the\nproblems it creates\nit's first important to understand what\nmakes it so alluring\npositive thinking the idea that you can\nchange your life circumstances by\nchanging your thoughts and your feelings\nvisualizing those goals that you have\nfor yourself truly being able to see\nclearly what it is that you want from\nlife\nthese things are not necessarily bad\nit's important before we continue that\nwe make this distinction\npositive thinking having set goals\nvisualizations\naffirmations meditating they all have\ntheir own place\nbut that isn't what i'm talking about\nhere the law of attraction\ntakes these things and adds an element\nof spirituality to it all\nfor some of you the law of attraction\nalready comes off as absurd\nbut understand that its popularity and\nthe money that flows in this industry is\neye-watering\nwhen you have people making so much\nmoney off something like this\nthen it's worth investigating the\nideologies these individuals promote\ndon't you think because at the heart of\nthis all lies a bigger problem\na problem that underpins self-help gurus\nnew age spirituality\nand success itself to those of you that\nalready believe in the law of attraction\nor things of that nature and are not\nwilling to have your belief\nquestioned or criticized then i would\nadvise not continuing\nmy only question now is how willing are\nyou to follow me down this rabbit hole\nthe law of attraction has a central\nclaim to its belief\nthat your thoughts and feelings vibrate\non a frequency and that this vibration\nis able to quote\nattract vibrations of a similar\nfrequency\nthe burden of proof then falls on loa\nbelievers to show that such a statement\nis true\nso is it after all wasn't it einstein\nwho said\neverything is energy and that's all\nthere is to it match the frequency of\nthe reality you want and you cannot help\nbut get that reality\nit can be no other way this is not\nphilosophy this is\nphysics except you never did\ndespite the quote being cited amongst\nlaw of attraction believers\nthese words were never actually uttered\nby einstein although just a small\nexample\nthis subtle deceit and distortion of the\nfacts seems to be a recurring theme the\nmore you dive into the law of attraction\npseudoscience consists of statements\nbeliefs or practices that try to claim\nlegitimate bearings in science using\nwords like\nlaw or vague references to quantum\nscience to make it sound valid\nof course pseudoscience specifically\nfails to comply with the scientific\nmethod which is what turns it into\npseudoscience in the first place\nit cannot be proven but deceit can be\nrather easy in the age of the internet\na quick google search of do your\nthoughts and feelings have a frequency\nwill produce an answer box that states\nevery thought and emotion has its own\nvibrational frequency or wavelength the\ntitle of this article\nis the quantum mechanics of changing\nthoughts but if one was to investigate\nfurther\nwe see that the article was written by\nquote dr kim and dr hill\nwho are both authors of the site itself\non their site they state that quote\ntogether they have\nover 20 qualifications in holistic\nmodalities including biofeedback\nneuro-linguistic programming tibetan\nbuddhism psychology\nhypnosis energy psychology coaching\nvisualization\nand meditation note however the lack of\na scientific background\nmore specifically the lack of any\nqualifications in physics and quantum\nphysics\nwhen looking back at the original\narticle we see that it is filled with\nassumptions and easily falsifiable\nclaims\nthe original article also contains a\nsub-link to another article\ntitled quote quantum mechanics and your\nauthentic potential\nin this article they make reference to a\nstudy by dr\nmasuru imoto emoto's study is commonly\ncited when attempting to prove the\nscientific basis for the law of\nattraction or the idea that thoughts and\nfeelings are able to affect the physical\nworld\nemoto claimed that our emotional\nenergies and vibrations could change the\nphysical structure of water his\nexperiments consisted of\nexposing water in glasses to

scientific testing\ncriteria emoto\ndid not participate\nonce more a prevailing theme around the\nsupposed science of the law of\nattraction\nare controversies criticisms and deceit\nwith obscure references to quantum\nphysics or brainwaves from individuals\nthat are seemingly unqualified to talk\non the subject\nit isn't a surprise that the law of\nattraction is considered a pseudoscience\nand isn't taken seriously in any form of\nmainstream science\nto the average person references to\nthese scientific terms often go\nunchecked and unverified\nbecause whoever is informing you sounds\nlike a figure of authority on the\nsubject by virtue of just mentioning\nwords like\nquantum and that's the point isn't it\nbecause the issues with the law of\nattraction doesn't stop at the science\neven if we cannot prove its existence\nthrough the scientific method\nthere remains fundamental flaws in its\npromoted ideology\nfloors that lay the land for people with\nquestionable intentions\nthere is a fundamental problem with the\nlaw of attraction\nsuppose you were to ask me the question\njames why don't you actually attempt to\ngive the law of attraction a try for\nyourself\nas opposed to just listening to the\ncriticisms and science\nwhy don't you give visualizations\naffirmations\nthinking on the level of that of which\nyou would like to attract into your life\na chance and suppose i truly did go\nthrough this idea\nfor a week for a month a year or even a\ndecade\ntwo scenarios may occur either i\nmanifest that of which i wanted into my\nlife\nor i don't which in and of itself can be\nsubjective\nlet's assume that i don't receive from\nthe universe that of which i wanted to\nattract i then come back to you years\nlater and tell you of my\nfindings what do you suppose if you were\na believer in the law of attraction\nyour response would be the reason the\nloa is not working\nis because you don't believe it works\nwhat's holding you back\nis a subconscious resistance or blockage\nor barrier\nyou are really really weighing your\nenergy down with a ton of resistance\nyou are manifesting probably the absence\nof something you want\nit is crucial to brainwash\nthat subconscious to wipe away that\nnegativity\nand herein lies the problem the law of\nattraction is\nat its core unfalsifiable and\nunfalsifiable claims or ideas pave the\nway for those who have bad intentions\nbecause if i were to sell you a course a\nprogram or a book promoting an\nunfalsifiable claim\ni am left completely and utterly\nblameless isn't that just convenient\nthe second part of this series will\nexpand on this idea further\ni'm aware that to those of you that\ntruly do believe in the law of\nattraction\nyour convictions may remain unwavering\nhow could it be wrong\nwhat could possibly explain those events\nin which my thoughts and feelings were\nso aligned that i genuinely manifested\nthat of which i was looking for\nhow can anything explain those constant\ncoincidences\neverything i wrote on this piece of\npaper has come\ntrue but when coincidences are\nthat specific and that they happen that\noften\nyou have to stop questioning things what\nabout the celebrities and the successful\npeople that credit the law of attraction\nto their success\nthey can't be lying they genuinely do\nuse the law of attraction themselves\njim carrey will smith oprah winfrey\nrussell brand conor mcgregor\njay-z arnold schwarzenegger steve harvey\nand the list goes on\nsurvivorship bias is a logical error\nmade when you concentrate on the people\nor things that made it past some\nselection process\nand begin to overlook those that did not\nsure\nthere are some famous and successful\npeople that credit the law of attraction\nto their success\nbut what about the 99 of those who also\nbelieve\nin the law of attraction but failed to\nget anywhere near that level of success\nin their lives\nconveniently we can lay out a bunch of\njustifications as to why they didn't\nachieve the same level of success\nbut surely a more rational and truthful\napproach would be to look at these\npeople's success as a multifaceted\nanswer that these individuals may have\nbeen stating their intentions into the\nworld visualizing their goals\naffirming themselves but none of these\nthings were necessarily the road map\nthat paved their success that there are\nelements of luck\ntalent upbringing hard work and\ncountless other factors at play here\nwhy make that logical leap into assuming\nthe law of attraction\nis the explanation confirmation bias\nalso seems to be rampant here\nbecause while someone like conor\nmcgregor is a firm believer in the law\nof attraction\nwe seem to look at his successful wins\nand fights and completely ignore the\nlosses\ndid mcgregor also manifest his losing\nfight against khabib\nof course the law of attraction may\nsuggest that such a loss was necessary\nfor mcgregor to manifest success in the\nfuture or that mcgregor wasn't truly\naligning his thoughts and feelings with\nhis intentions\nthe answer of course could never simply\nbe that the law of attraction doesn't\nexist\nthat the reasons for mcgregor's loss are\nto do with countless other variables\nbut what about those moments where you\ntruly did set your focus on something\nand seemingly coincidental occurrences\nor opportunities appeared out of nowhere\nthat specific and that they happen that\noften\nyou have to stop questioning things\nthe beta meinhof phenomenon is an effect\nthat arises when your awareness of\nsomething increases\nusually when you notice something new\nand suddenly you're aware of that thing\nall over the place it's sometimes\nreferred to as blue or red cast syndrome\nafter those who claim to notice blue or\nred cars everywhere all of a sudden\nafter purchasing their own\neven though nothing in reality has\nchanged take\nfor example an apple let me ask you\nwhile watching this video how many\ninstances did you notice the image of an\napple\nor the word apple how about you take\nanother look\n[Music]\n[Music]\nlaw of attraction believers may however\ncite something like the beta minor\nphenomenon\nas proof that their thoughts and\nfeelings are able to manifest or attract\nthat of which you desired but you didn't\nreally desire or set the intentions into\nthe universe of wanting to see apples\ndid you it seems like much of the law of\nattraction world applies motivated\nreasoning to their logic\nthey start with a conclusion and work\ntheir way backwards attempting to find\nanything that they could use to justify\nit\nwhilst throwing away any evidence of the\ncontrary\nnow imagine combining all of these\nbiases with the fact that many turn the\nlaw of attraction into an actual\nidentity and a core belief system\ncombine the emotional and financial\ninvestment people place into such a\nbelief\nand it becomes abundantly clear of\ncourse you want to believe in the law of\nattraction when you have invested so\nmuch into it\nof course you're not going to be willing\nto find a way in which you could\npossibly be wrong or willing to accept\nthat you're wrong\nso that leaves us with one last rebuke\nwhat's the problem here james\nwhy not let people believe in the law of\nattraction it's doing them no harm after\nall\nright if this were true then this video\nwould likely not have been made\nthe only problem is it isn't\n[Music]\nit may be hard to spot the red flags\ninitially\nbecause after all the concept begins\nwith something that sounds like a\ntruthful statement\nthing can feel positive and you will\nattract positive\nbut remember the inverse applies to this\ntoo\nthat thinking and feeling on a quote\nnegative vibration will also attract\nnegative manifestations into your life\nwe can likely all agree that it's best\nto think positively or that optimism has\nits place in living a happier life\nbut we would never expect someone to be\nfeeling great all the time\nor at least we would never try to place\nthat burden on someone else\nwe understand that it's okay to feel bad\nand guilting ourselves for feeling this\nway doesn't seem to be practical nor\ndoes it seem healthy\nbut consider emotions and thoughts\nthrough the lens of an individual who\nbelieves in the law of attraction\nwhy do you feel low why is that is it\nbecause you were vibrating on a negative\nfrequency\nwhen your day doesn't seem to be going\nwell why is that\nis it because you were the one that\nmanifested these things\nif you haven't achieved your goals yet\nis it because of your own failure to be\nthinking and feeling on the same\nfrequency\nas that of which you are trying to\nattract into your life\nunderpinning much of the law of\nattraction community is this notion of\nblame\nthat when things haven't gone your way\nat the heart of it\nyou are to blame and no matter how hard\nsomeone may argue that the law of\nattraction doesn't suggest you should\nfeel guilty when you are quote vibrating\non a lower frequency\nthe very idea that you are at fault is a\nfundamental premise in the law of\nattraction\nwhen you have an unfalsifiable belief\nlike this you quite literally begin to\ngaslight yourself\nbecause behind everything that happens\nto you or your surroundings is that\nrecurring question\ndid i manifest this into my life\nhow willing then would you be as a\nbeliever on the law of attraction\nto embrace negative emotions how willing\nwould you be to accept a bout of\ndepression\nhow willing would you be to suppress\nsuch emotions or thoughts on the basis\nthat they'll ruin your quote\nvibe imagine the psychological harm that\na belief system like this could cause\nand the level of paranoia that entails\nit\nthe law of attraction enables itself to\nbe a blameless entity\nwhere all blame falls on its believers\nis it a surprise then when i tell you\nthat it makes appearances in countless\nmulti-level marketing companies how to\nsucceed in\nmlm using law of attraction is it a\nsurprise that the law of attraction is\ndesigned perfectly for cult-like\nthinking\nbecause once more any critical thinking\nor doubts you have\nare encouraged to be suppressed don't\nbelieve\nit works what's holding you back is a\nsubconscious resistance or blockage or\nbarrier you are really really\nweighing your energy down with a ton of\nresistance you are manifesting\nprobably the absence of something you\nwant it is crucial\nto brainwash that subconscious\nany failure to reach the goals required\nby a cult or multi-level marketing\ncompany\nfalls not at the feet of the company but\nat your very own\nit's here where material harm in the law\nof attraction begins to show\nbut it doesn't stop here either because\nthe law of attraction\nextrapolates itself into the world of\nmedicine and health\ntoo where it claims that disease and\nillness can be blamed on your very own\nvibrations\nin ronda byrne's film the secret a film\nthat popularized the law of attraction\nat the mainstream level\nthere are several examples and quotes\nthat allude to the fact that disease\nlike\ncancer can be cured through the idea of\npositive thinking\nit is here where material harm surpasses\npsychological barriers and leads its way\ninto fatal consequences\nit is here where something that\ninitially sounds so harmless\ntakes a darker more serious turn\npositive thinking and optimism\nvisualizing your goals\naffirmations meditation are all on the\nsurface level\nreasonable and arguably beneficial\nhabits but is it possible to strip these\nthings away from the law of attraction\nalong with any pseudoscience that comes\nwith it\nis it possible to view these things on\ntheir own and to see them for what they\nare\nnot a road map to success or a secret to\nwinning the game of life\nbut a helpful tool if so then there is\none question that seemingly remains\nwhen we look at the law of attraction\nwho is it that stands to gain off of\nsomething like this\nwho benefits from being blameless who\nare the real winners of this ideology\nbecause make no mistake this\nis no small business\ni i had friends that were telling me\nthat the secret is real\nthere's this cult around napoleon hill\nbut in reality he was just a scam artist\nbut what you don't realize is they are\n[Music]\nyou know that's how good these guys are\nvemma and law of attraction basically go\nhand in hand\nyou gotta break through the logic\nyou cannot

some\ncritical details that you should have\nunderstood about what you were getting\nyourself\ninto stick with me now because it's\nabout time you find out exactly what\nthese details were\nbut before

right back into the video\n[Music]\nsoon though i looked into the history of\nthe company and what i found left me\nshocked and actually\nworried about my family it's a shame\nthat you're never doing it if you're\nnever working hard enough you're never\nbeing enough\nyou need more and more more\nmulti-level marketing companies fall\nunder different names\ndifferent products different people but\nthe overarching structure remains the\nsame\nthese companies don't sell their\nproducts via retailers but rather a\nworkforce of people who are paid a\ncommission on their sales sounds just\nfine\nso why the controversy let's start with\nits pyramid-shaped recruiting model\nmlms as they're often shortened to allow\ntheir distributors to recruit other\ndistributors who are called their\ndownlines\nuplines are able to earn a commission on\nany sales that their downlines make\nbut remember these downlines are also\nable to recruit their own members\nso it's a pyramid scheme right we'll get\nto that mlms have been around for a long\nwhile\nwith routes that go as far back as the\n1880s these companies have existed for\ngenerations and many of their practices\nremain the same\nthe promotion of self-help content and\nconcepts big conventions\nthe selling of a dream all of these\nthemes are prevalent in many of these\ncompanies\nsome of the top mlm companies are well\nknown for their female target market\naccording to the direct selling\nassociation 74\nof those involved with mlm companies in\namerica are women\nif you visit any stay at home mum's page\non facebook it won't take you long to\nfind someone promoting their mlm company\nthe mlm pitch appeals to those that are\nstruggling to make ends meet financially\nor those who are young and naive enough\nto be taken in by the grandeur of the\nevents and the barrage of self-help\nmessages\nthe controversy that surrounds these\ncompanies is endless the federal trade\ncommission has already received\n170 complaints against the company they\nmake you\nfeel guilty they will specifically\ntarget your insecurities\nan mlm's biggest weapon that they can\nuse against\nyou and that they do use against you is\nshame\none infamous example in 2012 saw\nbillionaire investor and hedge fund\nmanager bill ackman\ntake a short position on the mlm company\nherbalife\nhe called the company a flat out pyramid\nscheme what are you accusing herbalife\nof\nbeing a pyramid scheme we believe we're\nbelieve experiments game\nwhich sparked a wall street rivalry\nbetween himself and rival carl icahn\nwho started buying shares into herbalife\nto counter blackmon's position\nthis is not an honest guy and this is\nnot a guy who keeps this word and it's\nthe guy who takes\ntakes advantage of little people and yet\ndespite ackman's confidence\nhe exited his short position in 2018\nwithout success\nso what's really going on here is the\ndream real or one big lie\nwhy all the self-help content and the\ngrand conventions\nwhy aren't mlms illegal if they're\nsupposedly pyramid schemes\na pyramid scheme usually operates under\nthe following premise\nthere's a founder the founder tells a\nselect few people that for a certain\nprice they can join his amazing business\nopportunity\nit sounds great and they agree to buy in\nthese people are then encouraged by the\nfounder to recruit other people for a\nbuy-in to recoup their initial\ninvestment\neach new member of the scheme is\nencouraged to recruit somebody new\nand the money continues to be funneled\nup the system but any mathematician can\nsee the colossal\nproblem with this model and why it's\nmade illegal for everyone to make money\nin a pyramid scheme there needs to be an\nendless supply of recruits\nbut that's impossible if the founder\nrecruited five members\nand these five members recruited five\nmore members after 13 tiers you would\nhave exceeded the entire population of\nthe united states\nand after 15 tears you exceed the entire\npopulation of the planet\npyramid schemes are mathematically\ndesigned to collapse\nand when those on the bottom of the\npyramid start realizing that nobody is\nmaking money and drop out of the scheme\nthe tears above lose their ability to\nmake money and suddenly each tier begins\ncollapsing once they lose their only\nsource of income\nthese schemes are disguised as many\nthings and come in different shapes and\nsizes but their effects\ncan be devastating they place an\nemphasis on recruiting\nothers and are riddled with promises of\nhigh returns in short periods of time\nand claims of easy money or passive\nincome it is only those in the top tiers\nthat make money\nfrom a pyramid scheme and since most\npeople come in at the bottom tiers\nthe vast majority of those entering a\npyramid scheme will lose their money as\nfinding enough recruits to pay for their\ninitial investment gets harder and\nharder\nkeep that in mind now let's look at\ncults\nto spot one can sometimes be difficult\nbecause just like pyramid schemes they\nhide in plain sight\ndisguised as many things but that of\nwhich they actually are some red flags\non their own are not enough to draw\nconclusions\nbut combined they create a mantle piece\nfor manipulation and indoctrination\nthey're designed to influence who you\nare as a person step\nby step until you've walked so many\nsteps that you're no longer what you\nused to be and haven't even realized it\nyet those red flags include\na high level of commitment from its\nmembers and a seemingly unquestionable\nloyalty towards its leader or anyone at\nthe top of the hierarchy\na feeling that you're working towards\nsome sort of bigger goal\nmission or dream with the group your\nplexus business\nis an assignment from god to help you\nbuild your faith\n[Applause]\nthe promotion of an us versus them\nmentality the idea that you are a\ncollective group\na family and those that oppose the\nideals of the group are an enemy and\nmust not be listened to you\nwith us together it's family\nand nobody messes with the family anyone\nwho leaves the group\nare shunned by others because of this\ncritical thinking is often abandoned by\nthe group members\nyou can't question what you're being\ntold to be negative or critical about\nthe group's ideologies is the equivalent\nof betrayal\nyou cannot let logic control you\nlogic is is bad for us you're made to\nfeel dependent on the group\nover time the group becomes your only\nenvironment you don't see or speak to\nyour friends and family as much\nand in some cases you'll be made to lose\nany connections with your friends and\nfamily unless they're a part of the\ngroup too\nit's a process designed to isolate you\nfrom your past identity\nturning you into a drone that is\nentirely dependent on the group\nand the hopeful mission and vision that\nwhat you are doing is for the betterment\nof the world\nwith both pyramid schemes and cults\nthere's an assumption that to fall for\nit you must be a fool\nor an idiot but that isn't true in most\ncases an individual falls for these\nschemes and groups because of their\ncircumstances\nparticularly when they are in a\nvulnerable position the loss of a job\na loved one a lack of high quality\nrelationships a feeling of helplessness\nwith your life\nthese groups and schemes are designed to\nuse your emotions against you and\nexploit you in some way or another\nwhether financially or emotionally\nand that brings us back to mlms\n[Music]\nat its core multi-level marketing is a\nstrategy to market a product or service\nwithout needing to worry about\nadvertising costs or paying employees on\na standard payroll\nlegally these companies are not pyramid\nschemes\nas we saw a standard pyramid scheme\nmakes its money solely off recruiting\nmlms on the other hand revolve around\nthe selling of a product or service\nand paid distributors a commission on\ntheir sales therefore\nit is possible to make money in an mlm\nwithout recruiting someone else\nit's through this loophole that mlm\ncompanies can get away with being\nlegal pyramid schemes and that's a fair\nenough conclusion but with each mlm\nthere is a fine line and an\nall-important question that must be\nasked\nwhere is the majority of the revenue\ncoming from the actual selling of a\nproduct to organic customers\nor distributors buying product from the\nvery company they're working for\nso they can remain as distributors and\nwhat's encouraged more within your mlm\nthe recruiting aspect\nor the sales the more recruiting is\npushed the more you should question your\nposition in that company and the facade\nthat's being laid out in front of you\nand how real is the dream that you've\nbeen sold the promise of financial\nfreedom that draws in so many\ndistributors year after year\nwhat about the people that you hear\nabout who are making so much money from\nthe company\nlegally these companies are expected to\nrelease income disclosures each year\na chart that details the average\nearnings for distributors in the company\nwhich does not include\nexpenses in every mlm company that i\nhave seen\nthe vast majority of distributors will\nlose money whilst others will break even\nor make minimum wage\nit is the point one percent of those at\nthe top of the company that are making a\nsubstantial income\nthey're the ones that are praised and\nput up on stages at these events\nso that a survivorship bias is spread\namongst other distributors so the dream\nand the hope is not lost so that the\nother 90\nof those in the crowd don't realize that\nmost of them are not making money\nthat the dream they were sold is a lie\nand what about the self-help content the\ncult-like mentality that some of these\nmlms promote\nthey're designed to keep you hooked in\nto isolate you from any outside forces\nthat could persuade you from leaving\nand if you feel as though you're failing\nthen it must be your fault after all\nyou didn't work hard enough you weren't\npositive enough\nthat's why they indoctrinate you with so\nmuch\nself-help and guilt you into\nalways staying positive or else\neverything bad that happens to you is\nyour fault because you didn't try hard\nenough you didn't work hard enough\nand you didn't stay positive enough\nbut is my assessment of these companies\ntoo harsh\ntruth is i can't comment on every mlm in\nexistence\nwhen multi-level marketing is just a\nmarketing strategy each company has to\nbe looked at on a case-by-case basis but\nlet me point out some key flaws in this\nbusiness model that i think you should\nbe aware of\nthere is no screening process there is\nno interview to see how qualified you\nare for the job\nthe barrier to entry is negligible as\nlong as you have enough money to buy the\nstarter pack or the membership fee\nthese companies end up with countless\ninexperienced salespeople making money\nsolely through their commissions with no\nsense of accountability\nwhat could one possibly expect from such\na scenario especially when these people\nare encouraged to recruit more and more\nindividuals not based on their\nqualifications but on who they think are\nin a vulnerable enough state to buy into\nthe dream\ni targeted people like me\nmums young mums people maternity leave\nas it got towards christmas i actually\ntargeted people\nthat couldn't afford to pay for\nchristmas there is no grasp on supply\nand demand\nanyone can join and start selling the\nproduct and at some point the market for\nthat product will reach its limit but\nthe supply will continue to grow\nresulting with a bunch of distributors\ncompeting over the same market\nspreading the profits thinner and\nthinner between each other and what\nabout the actual products\nthe odds are usually stacked up against\ndistributors especially when they're\nselling products that have prices marked\nup three times higher than the standard\nretail price\nand being your own boss it's another\nfacade you're simply an independent\ncontractor for the company\nyou have no control over the products\nnor the commission structure\ni can't comment on all mlms but i can\nsay that if you are watching this and\nfeel as though you want to join one then\ndo your due diligence\nif you were sold a dream and quick money\ntread carefully\nif you see that the majority of the\nmoney is being made through recruiting\ntread carefully if a cult-like mentality\nis pushed and you're made to distance\nyourself from friends and family or are\nmade to feel guilty for not succeeding\nbecause you didn't work hard enough\ntread carefully the pursuit of financial\nfreedom\nor a better life and not uncommon dreams\nthey're shared by many\nincluding myself but if someone or\nsomething comes promising you that goal\nthat dream that vision\ndangling it in front of you like a\ncarrot on a stick disguised as an\nopportunity\nthen it's best you take a moment to\npause think rationally\nand remember that if it sounds too good\nto be true\nit probably is\nhello my friends and before you click\noff the video i just wanted to say\nthank you so much for watching to the\nend i've been wanting to do a video on\nmlms for a while now since the fake guru\nvideo\nso it's good to finally cover that\nindustry if you're new to the

the amount of attention\nthat's on you at any given time but the\nmore I thought about it and the more I\nrealized how wrong I was a personal\nbrand is simply you is how people\nperceive you what they

they have of\nyou their experience of you so what\nhappens when your reputation is built\naround being a toxic individual the\nvillain of the story what happens when\nthe thing people remember the

personally seen do\nsomething incredible with their\nreputation\nTyler Stein camp otherwise known as\nTyler one is a well known player of the\npopular online video game League of\nLegends as well as a streamer on the\nlive streaming platform twitch.tv when I\nwas first introduced to him like many\nothers at the time I saw an individual\nwho was well known for his toxic\nbehavior and again\nand then things changed Tyler one\nchanged his entire brand on what he was\nknown for from a player that was\ndisliked by the very company of the\nvideo game he played tell her what's not\nreally that much of a personality though\nI respect you is it nobody person\nsomeone that file as a gamer\nhis only marketable skills being an\n[ __ ] to be featured at their biggest\nevents in front of tens of thousands to\nowning a clothing brand a protein\nsupplement and other collectible items\ndedicated to his brand to amassing\nmillions of dollars in revenue\nthroughout his career averaging almost\ntwenty thousand live concurrent viewers\nper stream with a huge following on his\nYouTube and Twitter accounts of being\nwell-loved by the very community that at\nfirst wanted him gone or some may see as\na chain of lucky events and persistence\nI see is an almost seamlessly executed\nrebranding of an individual a must I'm\nnot the first to be talking about his\nstory and achievements I wanted to take\na deeper dive into Tyler as a brand and\nas a person and identify exactly how\nsomeone could have changed their entire\nreputation from most toxic to most loved\nfrom a villain to a hero all in the span\nof just two years\n[Music]\n[Music]\nless wind the clocks back to early 2016\nthe streaming platform twitch.tv was\nenjoying another year of growth in\npopularity\naided by Amazon's acquisition of the\ncompany in 2014 the platform reached a\ntotal of 2.2 million unique streamers\nthat entire year there was a platform\nthat allowed anyone with a computer and\na stable internet connection to stream\nthemselves playing video games for\nrandom viewers to come and watch live\nand what to some may sound like an\nincredibly niche community a streaming\nindustry was bustling with individuals\nwho are working as full-time streamers\nand earning huge paychecks at the end of\nthe month\nthanks to advertisements sponsorship\ndeals but mostly the donations of\nviewers tuning in to watch the stream\ndollars dude the front page of the site\nwould often present you with categories\nof different games to watch people\nstream and one of the most popular games\nto stream at the time was the\nmultiplayer online battle arena game\nLeague of Legends created by the company\nRiot Games in this period of early 2016\na search of the username lul Tyler won\nwould have presented you with the\nfollowing streamer\nTylar one most likely had a viewership\nthat didn't surpass fifty at any given\ntime this is a small sum when placed in\ncomparison to other streamers on the\nplatform it would have upwards of tens\nof thousands of viewers per stream Tyler\nwon or Tyler Stein camp as he is\nactually named which stream himself\nplaying the popular video game League of\nLegends in the dorm room of his\nuniversity his configuration mimicked\nthat of most streamers on the platform\non one section of the screen he would\nhave his webcam recording his face and\nreactions Welton Nutt more tax extreme\nna the other dominant part of the screen\nwas attributed to the video game itself\nto put it simply League of Legends\nfunctioned as follows two teams of five\nplayers would be placed on the opposite\nends of a map in their base the\nobjective of the game is to destroy the\nenemy's Nexus an object positioned in\nthe basis of both teams each player on\nthe team plays their own unique\ncharacter or champions as they are\notherwise named which are pre-selected\nbefore the game starts and each champion\nhas their own playstyle and often a\nposition on the map that is best suited\nto their abilities the average game in\nLeague of Legends is expected to last 35\nminutes the game also featured a ranking\nsystem allowing players to climb up the\nranks and prove their skills amongst\nother players of a similar skill level\nso why is any of that important\n[Music]\nyou see Tyler one was an incredibly high\nskilled player who was at the top of his\ngame he would often be much alongside\nother highly skilled and popular players\nin the game but these players didn't\nrecognize Tyler for his ability they\nrecognized him for his behavior\nTyler was well known for playing one\nparticular character in the game named\nDraven whereas typically you were\nexpected to play a selection of\nchampions and maintain some versatility\nTyler would only play during them and if\nhe didn't get to play Draven or if he\ndidn't like a particular player on his\nteam he would often intentionally run at\nthe enemy team giving them kills gold\nand experience all valuable assets that\nwould place his opponents at a greater\nadvantage of winning if you were on\nTyler's team during these matches the\ngame would be made considerably less\nenjoyable\nnot to mention Tyler had a habit of\ninsulting or demoralizing his teammates\nthat would often decrease the morale\nwith the players on his team fight this\nvideo over and over and over and over\nagain Jonna was [ __ ] toxic at work\nRiot Games had already banned several of\nTyler's accounts on the game in the past\nbut this didn't stop him from creating\nnew accounts and continuing to play\nneedless to say\nTyler's brand was built on being someone\ntoxic and although highly skilled if you\ndid anything that he didn't like your\nexperience with him would likely be an\nunpleasant one on camera his appearance\noften remained unchanged partially clean\nshaven head always sporting a tank top\noften wearing a pair of logitech\nheadphones he wouldn't speak a whole lot\non stream either mostly focusing on the\ngame making occasional comments and\ninteracting with live viewers that would\nsend messages which appeared in the chat\nroom to the right of the stream yo come\nwatch League man thanks a follow dude\nappreciate this welcome to the number\none toxic stream in a world that and\nalthough Tyler had built somewhat of an\ninside reputation amongst other high\nskilled players he remained fairly in\nthe dark he was just one streamer and\none player amongst millions in a heavily\nsaturated market right about now you\nwould have already formed your first\nimpressions of Tyler and whilst his\non-camera\nin game tough-guy attitude piqued the\ninterest of a small audience his overall\npersonality probably didn't strike you\nas anything special he was just a 20 21\nyear old university student studying\ncomputer science who also played for his\nUniversity's football team he just so\nhappened to have an obsession with an\nonline video game that he would stream\nhimself playing in between classes it's\nhard to know exactly what Tyler thought\nat the time but chances are he saw\nhimself graduating in a few years maybe\nstarting a career relative to his degree\nmaybe taken a career in American\nfootball more seriously but most likely\njust waiting to see what happens next\nleague of legends of streaming were just\none aspect of what seemed like a fairly\nordinary life but in March and April of\n2016 a series of events would change\nTyler ones future career life and brand\nforever\n[Music]\nLeague of Legends was an incredibly\npopular video game by all means with\nreportedly 100 million monthly active\nusers in the year of 2016 alone it's\nfilled with its own personalities\ncelebrities and culture league as it's\noften shortened to has had an immense\ninfluence over the growing eSports\nindustry generating crowds of up to tens\nof thousands and millions more online to\nwatch tournaments played by professional\nplayers there was no shortage of content\ncreators for the game and one such\ncreator went by the name of disco heat a\nYouTube channel well-known for a popular\nseries titled League of children which\nfeatured toxic an aggressive League of\nLegends players that would stream\nthemselves playing the game he actually\njust gave me cancer\nunbeknownst to these streamers disco he\nwould often take particularly egregious\nmoments and highlights from their stream\nand upload it to his channel these\nvideos would be watched by others in the\ncommunity that would laugh at or mock\nthe featured individuals for their\nbehavior on the 9th of March 2016\ndisco he uploaded a new video to the\nseries titled League of children high\nelo afk the video showcased a player\nwith a partially clean shaven head a\ntank top and a pair of logitech\nheadphones over his head\nwhat made this particular much\ninteresting was the fact that Tyler won\nwas playing with a well-known\nprofessional player in the game\nhi deulim otherwise known as c9 hi c9\nbeing the abbreviated form of the\nprofessional team he played for cloud\nnine\nthis match was a particularly bad one\nfor Tyler he made numerous mistakes\nduring the early parts of the game and\nthese further aggravated him as he\nstarted getting angrier and angrier at\nhis teammates this was met with a\nretaliation from hi who messaged Tyler\nin the game saying quote play the game\nstop raging thanks to which Tyler\nresponded with quote at bash you IRL so\nstop typing the heated exchange between\nthe two continued until Tyler grew fed\nup with the game and typed in the chat\nto his team quote dorm on fire sauce and\nproceeded to remain stood still at his\nbase in the game leaving his teammates\nto continue playing a now full vs. 5\nmatch making it considerably harder for\nhis teammates to win these actions were\nof course against the Community\nGuidelines and would often result in\nplayers getting their accounts banned\nbecause of it his team eventually\nsurrendered the game and the video\nconcluded with Tyler 1 adding hi to his\nint list a list that was stored on a\nnotepad file on his computer containing\nthe names of players he disliked in the\ngame next to highs name he wrote quote\ntrash kit this video received a large\namount of attention at the time and to\ndate the video stands at over 1 million\nviews this newfound attention raised the\ncommunity's awareness of Tyler won on a\nmuch greater scale than previously seen\nbefore new viewers began to pour into\nthe stream wanting to see Tyler's toxic\npersonality for themselves\n[Music]\nTyler would gain an audience of mostly\nthree different types of people those\nthat thought it was funny to watch this\nangry guy rage at his teammates if\nthings didn't go his way\nthose that rallied behind Tyler as he\nrepresented somewhat of a rebellious\nside to the community and those that\ndislike Tyler and hated the fact that\nsomeone was getting attention for being\na toxic player and promoting a\nparticular kind of behavior that makes\nthe game unenjoyable for others these\nthree types of audiences would often\nclash on his stream occasionally\ndonating money with a message that would\nappear on stream and be read out by an\nAI voice for Tyler to hear glad you're\ngetting all these donations and follows\nmen do your funny afk\nyou sir are hated because you don't let\npeople walk all over you the leaf\ncommunity is a bunch of keyboard\nwarriors here's to you goods I just\nwanted to say that you're a cancerous\ndegenerative li2 is only good for a\nlaughing yet it isn't hard to imagine\nthat this sudden newly found audience\nand source of income placed Tyler in a\npeculiar position the streaming industry\nwas saturated but this would have been a\npotential opening in the market for him\nto carve his own career from it but\nwhilst he had gained attention much of\nit came for all the wrong reasons\nit is at this point where I believe\nTyler made his first attempt to change\nhis reputation and brand in the\ncommunity in one particular highlight\nfrom his stream Tyler announced over the\nunderscore from the matrix soundtrack\nthat he would be reforming from now on\nand consequently his behavior was going\nto change what is now reform a few days\nlater Tyler released a video to his\nyoutube channel titled Draven hyped from\nmontage featuring the same speech about\nreforming he had made a few days ago\nalong with a montage of clips showcasing\nimpressive gameplay on his part\nthis was seen as an iconic video of\nTyler won and today it remains the most\npopular video on his channel with six\nmillion views there was also an early\nindication of Tyler's ability to craft a\nnarrative around his brand and create\nsomething meaningful from just one word\nreformed a word that he would\ncontinuously begin to associate with his\nbrand and what\nhe stood for but Tyler's attempts at\nreforming were not long-lived the\nproblem was that Tyler's temper and\ntoxic behavior whilst playing the game\ncould not be subdued and roughly a week\nafter announcing he was reformed after\nbeing demoted from one of the top ranks\nof the game Tyler\nannounces on stream that he is going\nback to being toxic right games gonna\ntell me how to play the Tribunal for me\nit's another play I'm toxic\nI'm Tyler one-eyed stay in that way\nlet's go sure Tyler had gained a\nviewership of thousands in a relatively\nshort period of time but his brand his\nreputation what others saw in him was an\nangry toxic player that whilst fun to\nwatch would make the game hard for\nanyone else that didn't see eye to eye\nwith him and whilst Tyler basked in his\nnewfound infamy and controversial\npersonality amongst the community the\nlooming enemy was growing in the\nbackground one threatened to end his\nfame as Swift as it had come\nplayers like Tyler won were a big\nproblem for riot games League of Legends\nrelied on teammates working together if\na single one of those teammates decided\nto intentionally throw a game it would\nmake the experience for all other\nplayers considerably unpleasant riot\nsolution to these players would usually\nbe banning their accounts something that\nthey had done to Tyler on numerous\noccasions but now that Tyler was gaining\na level of infamy it was in many ways\nglorifying his toxic conduct and sending\nsignals to other players in the\ncommunity that despite Tyler's in-game\nactions he could still be relatively\nsuccessful not only this but Tyler one\nwas spawning copycats of himself players\nwho would only pick Draven in their\ngames and if they didn't get what they\nwanted they would intentionally give\ntheir enemy team an advantage but the\npressure on Riot Games to act would grow\nsignificantly during that month of April\n2016 some of the biggest voices against\nTyler's brand were professional players\nthat were more established in the\ncommunity than Tyler himself one\nparticular example in that month of\nApril saw the professional player\nWilliam Hartman more commonly known as\nmeteos who at the time played for the\nprofessional team cloud9 criticized\nTyler's behavior while streaming doesn't\nmatter he's not funny meteos his\ncomments were later uploaded as a\nYouTube video and posted to the official\nLeague of Legends subreddit a post that\nquickly grew to the front page of the\nsubreddit the majority of the comments\non this post seemed to agree with meteos\nhis overall frustration they saw Tyler\nas a problem some even accounting\nstories on what it was like playing with\nTyler one himself or his copycats\nanother popular voice against Tyler was\nRiot Games his very own employee David\nTurley otherwise known as riot freak a\ncaster for professional league of\nlegends matches during his own stream he\nmade the following comments about tile\nI'm sad that like someone that vile is\nmaking so much money off the game now\nhis only marketable skills being an\n[ __ ] play\nTyler's popularity is infamy the brand\nhe had built for himself it was a\nticking time bomb and the more others\nheard about him the more the voices\nagainst Tyler want grew in that single\nmonth of April Tyler ones YouTube\nchannel reportedly hit 50,000\nsubscribers and more impressively his\ntwitch channel went from five thousand\nseven hundred followers to over 90,000\nin two months Tyler had gone from a\nuniversity student who just so happened\nto play league of legends to being\nbrandished with the title of the most\ntoxic player in North America with a\nsudden influx of viewers on his stream\nas well as money fame and money even on\na small scale have the potential to\nblind a person from the truth\namassed it's unclear how much Tyler\nearned from his streams during those two\nmonths\nit isn't far-fetched to assume that it\nwas a figure in the thousands he was\nenjoying the new potential path in his\nlife a career as a streamer playing a\ngame that he was obsessed with and\ndespite Tyler's initial attempts at\nclaiming he was reformed his reputation\nhad already been set in stone amongst\nthe community simply claiming that he\nwas reformed wouldn't be enough to\nredeem the actions of a player that had\nconsistently shown himself to be a toxic\nindividual disco heats video had spawned\na villain in the community and whilst\nfor some it was fun to be a fan of a\nvillain - Riot Games it was an issue\nuntil finally Riot Games took action and\nthe ticking time bomb that was Tyler's\nbrand was about to face its biggest bro\non the 30th of April 2016 Riot Games\nemployee Raya Socrates made a post to\nthe official League of Legends forum\nboard titled the indefinite banning of\nTyla wand it reads quote heyo\ninstant feedback catches the most\nunsportsmanlike players in league for\nsome go out of their way to continue\nruining games for the community because\nof a well documented history of account\nbans for verbal abuse intentional\nfeeding as well as account sharing /\npurchasing invasion of sportsmanship\nsystems and player harassment we will\nnot allow Tyler 1 to hold a league of\nLegends account indefinitely any account\ndefinitively used by him will be banned\nimmediately upon identification we know\nwe're not perfect and this dragged on\ntoo long but we want you to know what a\nrare player comes along who's a genuine\njerk we've still got your back this type\nof punishment from Riot Games was\nincredibly rare to see where as a band\non an individual's account meant that\nthey could simply create another this on\nthe other hand was known as an\nindefinite band sometimes referred to as\nan ID ban it meant that any evidence of\nan account being owned by the punished\nindividual would be met with a ban even\nif that account had not broken the\ncommunity guidelines of the game it was\nRiot Games essentially exiling someone\nfrom their game the news of Tyler's\nindefinite ban was posted to the League\nof Legends subreddit garnering so much\nattention that he appeared on our /all\npages of Reddit where some of the top\nposts from the entire site are featured\nthis meant the news of his band had gone\nbeyond the scope of the league community\nand could now be seen through the eyes\nof strangers that had no affiliation\nwith the game or Tyler won during the\ntime of this post Tyler won was live\nstreaming himself playing a game of\nLeague of Legends with a viewership\ncount to the tune of thousands and\npotentially tens of thousands unaware of\nwhat was happening he continued playing\nthe game until after it was finished he\nwas left to discover that the account he\nwas just playing on had been banned but\nsuddenly another wave of realization hit\nas Tyler discovered the news about his\nindefinite band live in front of his\nviewers\nboys you know what this means\n[Music]\nplease know what this means our here\nthe band meant that he could no longer\nstream the game that had made him\npopular in the first place it wasn't\njust a ban on him playing league it was\nintended to be a ban on his brand\nentirely I'm gonna miss you guys I miss\nyou guys I am it's been fun I've had a\nfun you know\na fun time treatment tea boys I have\nit's been fun\nsorry sorry I have I let you guys down\nhis answers to questions posed to him\nbys donators indicated that this could\nwell and truly be the end of tyler one\n[Music]\nit would have been rather\nuncharacteristic for Tyler to have given\nup he had received taste of Fame and a\npotentially huge source of income which\nalthough built on the wrong foundations\nthere may have still been hope for him\nthe Streisand effect is a social\nphenomenon that occurs when an attempt\nto hide remove or censor information has\nthe unintended consequence of further\npublicizing that information or in this\ncase Tyler won thanks to riots ban there\nwere new eyes on Tyler people were\nwaiting to watch his next actions on the\n2nd of May 2016 a few days after his\nindefinite ban Tyler posted a video to\nhis YouTube channel entitled vlog about\nwhat happened and future plans I was\nbanned from legal edges primarily\nforever no coming back you know how do I\nfeel about that men saw it coming did I\nsaw it coming I saw calm if if you guys\nknew everything I did they were they\nwere nice to me I'm at a post Natalia\nTyler acknowledged the fairness of his\nban something that is cynics perhaps\nwere not expecting but Tyler had bigger\nplans for himself and his reputation to\ncreate a real brand for himself Tyler\nneeded to be known for something other\nthan his toxic behavior in league he\nneeded to highlight a different aspect\nof himself\none that could eclipse the negative\nassociations of his current brand not\nonly that but Tyler would have to change\nthe narrative surrounding himself and\nhis reputation right now he was seen as\nthe most toxic player in North America\nwith a huge amount of controversy\nsurrounding his name in the league\ncommunity but there was one common\nsentiment often accredited to Tyler his\nability to entertain disco heat had\nproduced other videos on toxic players\nin the past but Tyler had received an\naudience unlike any of his predecessors\nthe reasoning for this was likely due to\nhis ability to keep viewers entertained\nby his tough-guy attitude and overly\nconfident antics\nTyler needed to create a Redemption arc\nfor his brand the toxic player that\nchanged his ways and became known for\nsomething much bigger than just being a\nleague of Legends player his initial\nattempts at claiming he was\nformed whilst being caught on by his\nfans at the time was not enough to let\nthe message stick he needed to embark on\na journey to prove that his brand was\nmuch more than what people had initially\nassumed and so after Tyler's\nannouncement that he would continue to\nstream he began to carve for himself\na bigger name in the streaming community\nit was unlikely that anyone could have\npredicted just how big Tyler would get\nin the upcoming months\nTyler began by playing different games\nshowcasing his personality by placing\nhimself in different virtual scenarios\nall while streaming it to a viewership\nthat remained in a thousand a viewership\nthat was filled with both new and old\nfaces he streamed himself playing a\nrange of different games from different\ngenres the game out last saw Tyler\nexplore haunted mental asylum with his\nviewers with his share of scary moments\nand Tyler's commentary that ran\nthroughout his playthrough outlast\nbecame a fan favorite for Tyler to\nstream at the time but his versatility\ndidn't stop there\nreviewers watched as Tyler played games\nlike Club Penguin a children's game in\nwhich shortly after beginning the\nplaythrough he began to criticize and\nwas eventually banned from the game due\nto his use of profanity much to the\namusement of his viewers while streaming\nhimself playing other games\nTyler was also granted permission by\ntwitch to coach some of his viewers\nwhilst they played his favorite\ncharacter Draven in league i'ma teach\nyou guys I true fans at a Play dream\nthese streams would consist of Tyler\nspectating a viewer live as they played\nleague whilst providing commentary\neither criticizing or praising their\ngameplay streaming has its own unique\nadvantage when it comes to creating a\npersonal brand especially in the case of\nTyler one when a viewer is exposed to\nhours and hours of content from a single\nindividual it becomes easier to grow\nfond of that person to those that watch\nTyler throughout his streams of which\nthe highlights were posted to his\nyoutube channel the more his audience\nbecame attached to Tyler's personality\nI had to wait I had to as Tyler\ncontinued to open up to his audience on\nstream all whilst attending University\nhis audience grew rapidly in early May\nTyler had reportedly reached a following\nof a hundred thousand on both twitch and\nYouTube later that month he revealed to\nhis viewers live on stream his new\nwebsite featuring various merchandise\nwith notable references to inside jokes\nhis audience would recognize but Tyler's\njourney and what truly made him the\npopular figure that he is today was only\nat the brink of its beginning during the\nsummer break of 2016 Tyler began\ndisplaying his talent to not only\nentertain but also his ability to\ncreatively change up the content of his\nstream these streams would vary from him\ncooking various meals to a somewhat\nquestionable degree of quality to him\nsinging songs that would otherwise\njuxtapose his tough-guy temperament\n[Music]\nTyler would further reveal more size to\nhimself as the streams continued and as\nhis popularity rose in the streaming\ncommunity so too did his income in early\nAugust 2016 Tyler officially announced\non his stream that he withdrew from\nUniversity and would now be embarking on\na new future as a full-time streamer he\nhad successfully found his place in the\nsaturated market of streaming allowing\nhim to earn what could only be assumed\nto be a sizable income from his donators\nand merchandise whether he was in his\nkitchen cooking or his backyard grilling\nTyler continued to do things for his\nstream that were beyond what was\nexpected followers on entertaining you\nguys the chat the viewers he\nconsistently proved day in and day out\nthat what he should be known for was not\nhis toxicity from the past but as a\npersonality and an entertainer viewers\nwatched him create a bonfire whilst he\ncomplained about his constant habit of\nstuttering something they had become an\nongoing joke in his streams\nI can't tell story employs I'll stutter\nI stuttered too much I can't talk No\nstop stuttering you've done good so far\nthey just stop it\nstop stirring other ongoing jokes from\nhis stream included his favorite\nMcDonald's meal combination of to make\nchickens and two apple pies often dubbed\nby his fans as the Tyler one special his\nheight was another ongoing joke Tyler\nwould often claim himself to be six foot\nfive whilst his fans stated that he was\nin fact five or six of which the latter\nwas proven to be true but Tyler never\nceased to continue the joke he had a\ntalent for turning many aspects of\nhimself things that he loved and moments\nin his career into memorable\ncharacteristics of his brand including\nwords like reformed or phrases like hehe\nXD a phrase that Tyler would commonly\nuse during his toxic days in league that\nquickly stuck with fans during this\nperiod\nTyler befriended one of his fans Dimitri\nAnton Otto's more commonly known on the\nstream as Greek god X or simply Greek in\nreference to his username on the twitch\nplatform the two of them had chemistry\nwith each other that seemed unrivaled by\nany other streamer on the platform at\nthe time and as they streamed together\noften using software like discord or\nSkype to communicate Tyler would be\nfrequently at the forefront of attention\nwith Greeks voice heard in the\nbackground as the pair either played\ngames together or participated in\nimprovised sketches with each other\nthese streams are still greatly\nconsidered to be some of Tyler's best\nand the time is witnessed Tyler carved\npumpkins for Halloween discusses\nrelationships on stream with both the\nups and downs that came with them me and\nBailey have a date next Saturday they\nsaw him react as his mother texted him\nto say that she has made it through an\nimportant operation Omaha texted me she\nsaid\nthey saw him cook lasagna dress up as\nother internet personalities paint\nwhilst dressed up as the TV personality\nBob Ross they saw him struggle to give a\nhouse tour on stream they saw him\ncompete with his brother to create a\ngingerbread house they saw him dress up\nas Santa for Christmas doing a clown\nshow\npainting eggs for Easter these moments\nproved to everyone and his continuously\ngrowing fanbase that he had changed\nTyla hood irrefutably grown his\npersonality brand and reputation into\nsomething far greater than just the most\ntoxic player in north america by most\naccounts he had changed the narrative\nsurrounding who he was people recognized\nhim phase entertainment his audience\nwatched to see Tyler not the games that\nhe played but in order for Tyler's\nRedemption arc to complete there was one\nstain on his brand and his story that\nneeded repairing his relationship with\nRiot Games\n[Music]\nour styler continued streaming his\nreputation amongst the lead community\nwas changing as opposed to being the\ntoxic player that deserved his\nindefinite ban the community was\nstarting to see him as someone who was\nchanging his ways and Tyler did his best\nto prove that they were right whilst off\nstream Tyler would continue to play\nleague of legends and before riot would\neventually discover and ban the accounts\nhe played on he would attempt to keep\nhis composure and stay reformed which\nmeant even if things were not going his\nway he would refrain from intentionally\nthrowing games in fact during the months\nof May to early July 2017 Tyler took a\nbreak from streaming and played league\nof legends for what he claims to be 15\nto 20 hours per day Tyler would often\nshare stories on a stream of how his\nbehavior has changed furthering the idea\nthat Tyler was indeed were formed I lost\ntwo massive promos I did not say a\nsingle word of Chet and as this\nnarrative continued to grow a movement\nin the community began to grow alongside\nit an official broadcast by Riot Games\nfor professional tournament to twitch\nviewers would often flood the chat with\nchants of free Tyler one bear in mind\nthat these broadcasts were nothing small\nthey would gone on hundreds of thousands\nof live viewers each stream even more\nnotable were free Tyler one sign spotted\nduring the broadcasts the community\nbegan calling for Tyler's unbanning\nstating that he had changed his ways and\ndeserved to be brought back in many ways\ndespite his indefinite banning Tyler had\nbeen contributing greatly to the League\nof Legends community whether through his\ncoaching streams for his constant\nreferences to the game and its community\non stream but despite all of this riot\nremained fairly cold to the idea of\nTyler's return the situation was so bad\nthat Riot Games resorted to banning free\nTyler one signs at their events as well\nas banning viewers from typing free\nTyler won in professional broadcasts the\nnarrative had changed Tyler who had once\nbeen the villain of this story and\ncommunity was now seen as the hero Riot\nGames on the other hand where the evil\nconglomerate holding him back but\nTyler's biggest contribution to the\nleague community would come during the\nlatter half of 2017 a contribution that\nwas impossible for right to ignore much\nlong\nduring the months of August September\nOctober and November of 2017 Tyler had\ndecided to create organize and host his\nvery own online League of Legends\ntournament titled Tyler won Championship\nSeries abbreviated to simply TCS still\nbeing banned from the game he couldn't\nplay in the tournament himself but some\nof the participants included well-known\nplayers from the community that were\neither personalities themselves or\nprofession was playing in eSports teams\nTCS even had a total prize pool of\n$10,000 from Tyler's own pocket and the\ntournament culminated in a grand final\nbetween two teams this best-of-five\nmatch took place on tyler one stream for\nviewers to tune into for those who\nhadn't seen Tyler's progression up to\nthis point the event would have truly\nbeen something to behold\nTyler was once more doing something that\npeople didn't usually expect from\nstreamers on the platform the stream\nwasn't anything special when it came to\nproduction value\nit featured Tyler in a shirt with cutoff\nsleeves green screen effects and awkward\ntransitions between scenes and yet all\nof these things made it all the more\nenjoyable the only sponsor for the\ntournament was Tyler won himself that\nwas all and yet this dream\nsingle-handedly peaked over 200,000 live\nviewers a number that not even some\nprofessional league of Legends\nbroadcasts could match needless to say\nTyler's tournament was well received by\nhis fans and the Lee community it\ninstantly became the biggest amateur\nleague tournament to exist and hide the\nsurrounded Tyler one who'd reached to\nnew heights he had created a noise that\nRiot Games could no longer ignore but\nduring these months Riot was facing PR\nissues of their own on October the first\naround the same time TCS was taking\nplace a Reddit user made a post to the\nofficial League of Legends subreddit\nthat quickly climbed to front page the\npost linked screenshots of messages made\nby Riot employee Aaron Rutledge\notherwise known as Reyes and juror on\nthe official League of Legends discord\nserver in response to a member of the\nserver making a joke about there being\nno point in attending professional\nleague event if they couldn't make a\nfree Tyler one sign rutledge mockingly\nreplies quote free Tyler one to make a\nhundred K plus a year for being it\ndidn't gain a game he didn't make he\nthen continued to comment on tile\none stating quote he looks like a damn\nhomunculus and quote honestly it's fine\nhe will die from a coke overdose or\ntesticular cancer from all the steroids\nhe further went on to reveal in these\nmessages that he personally had to ban\nseveral of Taiwan's accounts emphasizing\nthat his anger towards Tyler was\nsomewhat personal will had been comments\nmost likely intended to remain in that\ndiscord server Rutledge had failed to\ntruly understand just how many fans\nTyler had built over the course of his\nban and just how many of them wanted to\nsee him come back to the game and just\nlike that Rutledge had given them their\nsmoking gun the original post made to\nReddit received so much attention that\nit was displayed on the front page of\nReddit meaning even those with no\ninterested in the game or Tyler won were\nable to see the post and Rutledge's\ncomments within hours of this post\ncoming to light it immediately became\nclear to the league community that\nRutledge's actions were going to be met\nwith serious repercussions and may end\nup being a historic moment for both Riot\nGames and Tyler one another employee\nfrom Riot Games commented on the post\nstating quote to be very clear here what\nwas said is not OK and we take it\nextremely seriously I'd like to\napologize on behalf of riot to both\nTyler won and the community for this we\nwill be taking action internally to\naddress this tyler responded swiftly to\nthe growing drama on twitter stating\nquote it really sucks that some people\nstill hold a massive garage versus ot1\nand refused to acknowledge i've changed\nwith that being said i have no hard\nfeelings towards the guy it happens with\nthis move Tyler had cleverly turned the\ntides of the narrative between himself\nand riot now it was Riot Games who were\nthe toxic individuals whilst Tyler was\nthe forgiving victim in this incident\nthe very next day Aron Rutledge made a\npost to his Facebook wall stating quote\nheads up to my friends and family I no\nlonger work at Riot Games please call or\ntext me for more details\n[Music]\nboth tireless successful tournament and\nthe rutledge drama rallied a new level\nof popularity for Tyler one amongst the\nleague community as cause to unban him\ngrew stronger\nTyler ones brand was established he had\nshown himself to be a big part of the\nleague community and now the cards were\non rye aside it was their time to act\nand for a while it seemed like riot\nwould continue to ignore Tyler leaving\nhis Redemption arc incomplete\nTyler himself took a break after the\ngrand finale of TCS leaving people\nunsure of what was to come until finally\nit happened on the 4th of January 2018\nTyler posted the following on his\nTwitter account quote after six hundred\nand thirteen days of intense rehab I am\nfinally unbanned from League of Legends\nfollowed by an announcement that he will\nstart streaming again\nthe following Monday\nOn January of 2018\nTyler returned to twitch and League of\nLegends donning what was intended to be\nthe costume of his favorite champion in\nthe game\nDraven older new fans alike eagerly\nawaited his return often news of his\nunbanning and watched as Tyler was\nfinally able to play league on stream\nafter six hundred and thirteen days I\ncan finally finally play League of\nLegends without getting my account bad\nnow even more impressive was Tyler's\nview account his stream peaked at three\nhundred and eighty six thousand live\nviewers which at the time was a record\nfor any streamer on the twitch platform\nTyler had done something indisputably\nimpressive with his reputation and\nultimately his brand and as his dreams\ncontinued throughout the year despite\nfocusing or League of Legends he would\noccasionally vary things up with his\nusual entertaining skits costumes and\noverall antics tyler became one of the\nmost viewed league streamers instantly\nand the community had mostly welcomed\nhim back with open arms and so did Riot\nGames it seemed as they turned Tyler\ninto something even more than just a\nstreamer for the game in the latter half\nof that year Riot Games would invite\nTyler on stage on one of their biggest\nevents of the year\nteller was not really that much of a\npersonality though I respect you is\nnobody the person someone that file as a\ngamer as a streamer his only marketable\nskills being an [ __ ]\nto the dance he's gonna help us break\ndown this bastard not only was tireless\nshowcased on that broadcast but he\nplayed a game alongside other\npersonalities and players live on stage\nto hundreds of thousands of viewers from\na player that had once been seen as a\nnegative influence over their game a\nplayer who had been brandished with the\ntitle most toxic player in North America\na player that had received a rare\npunishment by the company to someone\nthat would now be considered by others\nin the community as the face of League\nof Legends Tyler had done it he had\nsuccessfully rebranded himself through\nchanging the narrative surrounding his\nimage through creating memorable moments\nfor his viewers through his undeniable\nwill to create entertaining streams his\nreputation what people were membered\nabout him their experience of him it had\nchanged when I recalled the story of\nTyler one from my teenage years of\nplaying league of legends myself and\nfirst hearing about him on Reddit\nwatching him get banned to seeing him\nchange an entire community and platforms\nperception of him I can't help but see\nthe growth in who he was and what his\nbrand became from a student in his\nuniversity dorm occasionally streaming a\ngame to his viewership of perhaps 50 or\nso people to an entertainer on a stage\nfilled with thousands and millions more\nwatching from home I can't help but\nthink I witnessed someone execute a\nrebranding of himself almost perfectly\nand even as Tyler's story continues to\nthis day his prior history was the first\nlesson I had received an understanding\nthat a brand isn't about the subscribers\nthe followers or the amount of attention\non you at any given time it's their\nexperience of you what they remember the\nmost about you but even so I always\nwonder even to this day if Tyler hadn't\nfirst been the most toxic player in\nNorth America would any of this have\never happened would I even be here\nmaking this video\nhello my friends and before you click\noff the video just yet I do want to take\nthe time to say thank you so so so much\nfor watching to the end this project has\nbeen the biggest I've ever done as you\ncan probably imagine if you've been\ntuning into the channel so if

step\nby step how my students are earning six\nand even seven figures working from\ntheir laptops from home that's the most\nessential point\nit doesn't matter if you really don't\nknow what you're talking about you can\nhire an expert get them to write a\nscript and you can read out to a video\ncamera\nthey approached MJ and they were like\nhey can you make part of our course for\nus because to be clear I don't know why\nbut my guess is they don't know what\nthey're doing on Amazon\npreferably you have a little bit of\nexperience that you can give some\ngeneral knowledge out there that can\nprobably be found in a book or if you\ngoogle searched it again guys it doesn't\nmatter about what is in the course\nthat's not what's important here what's\nimportant is how you market it this is\nthe stage that separates the bottom tech\ngurus from the guys who are actually\nmaking the big money you see it's all\nabout marketing in this industry and if\nyou can't market your course properly\nthen you're not gonna make as much as\nyou should be you want to start by\nrunning some YouTube ads and Facebook\nads Instagram ads look wherever the hell\nyou can find people who are young enough\nand probably in a vulnerable position to\nwhere they want to buy into wherever the\nhell you're selling them which leads us\non to the next point sell a dream you\ncan make enough money to be financially\nfree you could be generating profit in a\nmatter of just hours if not just a few\ndays running six figures yeah my\nstudents are earning six and even seven\nfigures working from their laptops from\nhome the tough goal\nfinancial freedom when I say to what\nfinancial freedom what picture comes to\nmind right a beach this year alone I've\nhave 76 people leave that jobs and\nbecome financially free I was able to go\nfrom being completely broke in dead-end\nuniversity to making over 86 thousand\ndollars in just my first 60 days\nrested in creating a passive income\nstream that I'm traveling around the\nworld been able to do some really cool\nstuff trap the world and it's all there\nfor you if you just click the link below\nand sign up to my free training register\nfor that training join our completely\nfree training and it's all revealed\nright here in this book I'm gonna give\nyou this for freedom the goal with this\nad is to hook them in you want to really\ndig into their emotions you want to make\nthem feel like wait wow this guy's\nearning six figures and he's thrown up a\nbunch of testimonials of his students\nand I can do this as well sure I'll\nclick your link got him you see here is\nwhere you lead your prey into the next\nstage of your funnel this is where they\nenter your webinar your free live event\nthey buy your free book whatever it is\nmake sure you keep it a little lengthy\nin the case of a webinar one to three\nhours you see the longer it is the more\ntime they get to spend with you and the\nmore trust they build towards you and\nthe higher the chance that you can sell\nthem on higher priced courses\nanother thing is make sure they're not\ndistracted if you want to make sure that\nthat whole attention is focused on you\nin this webinar in this moment turn off\nthe social media to tell your family\nleave me alone close down Facebook turn\noff Netflix turn off Instagram you know\nhide your phone if you need to for the\nnext 60 minutes because this exact\ntraining has changed literally thousands\nof lives and it can do the same for you\nnow oh hold up you're probably saying\nbut but James I don't have any\ninformation to tell them what do I teach\nthese people\ncome on we're not trying to teach them\nanything in these webinars the goal of\nthe webinar is to make them ask even\nmore questions and the goal after that\nand the main goal is to get them to buy\nyour course got it\nnow you want to tell them your back\nstory your sob story tell them that\nyou're just like them and you were poor\nand there wasn't anything special about\nyou I never got very good grades at all\nand think I was the low average and\npretty much the only thing I was good at\nwas hanging out with my friends and\ndrinking beers\ngrowing up I was a loner alone that all\nthe way through high school and I got\nbeat up quite a few times tell them how\nyou hated your job how you were stuck in\nthe rat race I would literally drive an\nhour to work each day I was working as\nan accountant working 80 hours a week\ndepressed anxious it just felt like a\njail cell I felt my life literally being\nsucked out of me minute by minute what\nyou need to do is you need to sound like\nyou're in the position that they're in\nat that current point in time and if\nyou've done your youtube ads right and\nyou've probably attracted the most\nvulnerable of these people then believe\nme there was other failures in between\ntimes when I didn't sleep for months on\nend up all night stress the people who\nare broke and people who really want to\nmake money or a young and naive enough\nto feel like the course can get them to\nthat point those are our ideal targets\nam I gonna be that broke kid and be like\neverybody else in my family or am I\ngonna finally step out I felt that I\nknew there was more like you know\nthere's more sometimes you just don't\nhave the path in the plan it's also\nimportant to know that you want to\nrewire their mentality and their mindset\ntell them that money is abundant money\nnever goes away here's the thing it's\nnot scarce you need to spend more energy\non how to generate the money not save it\nit's not going away it's not about the\nmoney it's about the freedom it's about\nthe time with your family tell them that\nthere's so much money on there guys\nso that when it comes to the point where\nyou give them the price of your course\nin their heads the objection of oh it's\ntoo expensive is already overcome when\nthey're like but oh he told me the money\nis abundant doesn't matter if I finance\nthis with 2,000 pounds money I don't\nhave because money's everywhere man\njust like he said but here's the thing\nyou want to tell them that they have to\nput in the work right you want to tell\nthem that they need to be responsible\nfor what they do I'm only looking for\npeople who are dedicated to this who are\ngonna be focused on this business for\npeople who are willing to put in work\nthis is for real people we're willing to\nput in real work I need to take action\nif you're still with me today you're an\naction taker anyone anywhere from any\ncountry on earth can earn a full time\nliving on Amazon if they're willing to\nput in the work listen if anybody ever\ntold you it was easy to get rich they're\nselling you something and they're lying\nto you right because it's not easy to\nget rich and that's why most people when\nthey reach the age of retirement right\nthey can't retire most people you know\nare gonna find themselves because when\nthey buy you a course and it doesn't\nwork for them you want to make sure that\nthey're not blaming you that that's\ntelling themselves you know what it's my\nfault that this didn't work now you want\nto go for the hard sell show them\ntestimonials of previous students who\nhave gone on your course say look here's\nJohnny and he made 100 grand in his\nfirst month of doing it so it took him\none year to get to six figures four\nthousand dollars from two clients over\nfifteen hundred dollars in one single\nday $7,800 in the span of about a week\nmake it sound easy easy easy easy you\ndon't have to have any experience to get\nstarted gonna have new tech skills to\nfind your software you need your own\nproduct you never have to meet with an\nagent where you never look at a house\nyou don't have to negotiate the way that\nthrough an agent all those pieces don't\nneed to be an expert you don't need to\ntake the risk of failing you don't need\nto hire employees or no matter your age\nno matter where you live no matter your\ncircumstances can create a full time\nincome zero money needed you don't have\nto wait for closing it all happens in\nabout 10 or 14 days it's copy and paste\nthem into your listing and your PPC\ncampaigns and it's easy as that but it's\nnot a get-rich-quick scheme guys make\nsure you don't say if we get rich quick\nscheme\nsay everything but it's tough listen if\nanybody ever told you it was easy to get\nrich it's literally as simple as buying\nproducts for a dollar and selling them\non amazon.com they're selling you\nsomething and they're lying to you right\nit's are earning passive income from\nAmazon you know sometimes even 30 days\nor less because it is not easy to get\nrich and that's why most people when\nthey reach the age of retirement right\nthey can't retire I'm lazy I don't want\nto work hard and I want to make a lot of\nmoney so I mean if you're like me and\nyou're lazy and you don't want to work\nvery hard but you want to make a lot of\nmoney then this opportunity is gonna be\nperfect for you right for hold on\nsome of these people still have a bit of\na rational part in their brain which we\ndon't want some of them are probably\nthinking it seems a bit too expensive to\nbuy a 2500 pound course I don't really\nthink I can afford that so here's what\nyou want to do you want to create\nscarcity so if you want to get these\nadditional bonuses you need to join now\nand if you're gonna think about it\nyou're gonna miss out on this these\nbonuses are only available for a very\nlimited time and are only available for\nthe people who are really ready to\ninvest into their future today because\nonce these bonuses are gone guys they're\ngone forever for people on this webinar\ntoday only I'm going to do it for one\nthousand nine hundred and ninety nine\ndollars you can tell them it's okay to\nfinance it with their credit cards or\nwhatever that helped the money if the\nmoney is the biggest hurdle but if you\nhave the desire if you have the time if\nyou have the willingness we have an\noption for you you can actually use\nPayPal credit and you can actually get\nstarted for almost little to no money\ndown it's essentially free today\n[Music]\nnow you can sit back and watch that\nsweet sweet profit flying when I say the\nword financial freedom what picture\ncomes to mind right a beach you're\nsitting on your city mother what is it I\nwas about this\nswing thing when you're drinking your\nway but why stop there\nyou didn't really think we were just\ngonna be selling courses right remember\nour goal is to get them hooked on our\nproducts you want to create your ladder\nit's not just about the course the\ncourse is the first step the next step\nis selling them the mastermind program\nwhich is like 200 pounds a month the\nnext one after that is selling them to\nyour live event which is 300 pounds a\nmonth and then sell them on the even\nbigger course of better course which is\n5,000 you practically have an army with\nyou these guys have watched you\nreligiously and people think oh it's\nonly a course it's only $2,000 first of\nall a lot of people to have don't have\nto time sorry to say pleasure this is\nwhy I do the show that's 26 thousand\ndollars are you listening everyone at\nhome are you listening make them feel\nspecial with your live events you know\nmake them feel like a celebrity like\nthey're actually achieving something\ntell them to all dress up in suits if\nyou have to and tell them they're all\ndoing well and you're all gonna be\nsuccessful and remember trust your guru\n[Applause]\nnow we got absorbed and of course you\ndon't tell them the truth\nright I mean after all we're selling\nshovels a gold rush we don't tell them\nthat the reason we're so damn rich and\nlive in the life and they want to live\nis because we've sold them a dream and\nsold them our courses that aren't really\ngonna get them there II found a\nconsistent source of income of thousands\nof dollars every month and all he did\nall he had to do was sell more access to\nhimself but I guess you're sitting back\nthere in your mansion sipping your\nchampagne and wondering man I wonder how\nnone of these people have said anything\nyet well that's the thing you see if you\nremember correctly we told them that\nthey are responsible for their own\nactions\nso each course that they buy and each\nfailure that they get they are the ones\nthat feel like they're completely\nresponsible a lot of people can be like\ndude you know well that's your fault for\nQueen your job but hey I'm one of\nhundreds hundreds if not thousands of\npeople in that program who did the same\nthing everyone I knew quit their jobs\nI guess parmi was ashamed just like\neverybody else a lot of people are\nashamed that's why a lot of people don't\ncome forward oh yeah oh yeah there are\npeople watching right now who aren't\ngonna come for it's an orchestrated\nthink he uses your psychology against\nyou I mean some of these guys are so\ndesperate in their situations that they\nhave to believe it's gonna work for them\notherwise the alternatives far worse one\nof these guys I knew that was struggling\nhe handed his Craig card over the two\ndamn logs lackeys and he said I'm\npraying that this goes through\nand it didn't he got declined and he\njust melted on the floor he was crying\nand then another guy was like I got\ndeclined too he's like man if I could\nsell my soul right now I would I'm look\nout Mike you're joking he's like I would\nsure some of these people are in debt\nand they falling out with their friends\ncuz off the rule you told them to kick\nout the negative people and their family\nthinks they're part of some college it\ndoesn't matter at the end of the day you\ngot your millions right you can sit back\nenjoy it and watch your webinar and your\ncourses all sell themselves the thing is\nI don't really have anything against\nonline courses I think online courses\nare amazing in fact they taught me to\nedit the video that you're watching\nright now they taught me a lot about\nmarketing they taught me about personal\nfinance but the kind of courses that I'm\ntalking about but they're not thousands\nof pounds most of them I got on udemy\nand they're like 10 quid here and\nthey're about probably in total I spent\ntwo hundred pounds on online courses\nthey're not trying to sell me a dream\nthey're not trying to tell me I'm\nessentially gonna get rich quick unless\nand that's kind of the problem with I\nthink a lot of these internet gurus\naside from all of the moral stand points\nit's more about the fact that they're\nreally cheapening one online course\nisn't how good online education can be\nthe next time you kind of come across\nthese gurus or someone that sells you a\ncourse for thousands really really\nquestion whether the value that they\ngive you in that course is worth that\nmoney because the chances are you can\nfind any of this information in a book\nor just doing your own YouTube searching\nwhich is probably where they got the\ninformation from anyway\nwhat's important to always look out for\nis is what they're telling me the method\nin which they got rich themselves one\nwith most of these people selling the\nonline course just probably isn't once\nyou spot the signs that you're listening\nto or you've bought into the product of\na\nonline fake guru just run it's really\nnot worth it and I mean it when I say\nthat most of them are just trying to get\nyou addicted to their products because\nafter who you are just a number in their\nfunnel to them and ultimately you're\njust the number in their bank account to\nthem you're gonna see more and more of\nthese online gurus I think personally a\nlot of them aren't gonna last I think\neventually some of them are gonna get\nextremely unethical they're gonna be\ncaught out in some sense well there's\ngonna be some kind of regulation but for\nyour own sake just don't get into them\nin the first place\nso thank you guys for watching till the\nend of this video my name is James\nJanney if you liked what you saw please\ndo

      "transcript": "I have had this conversation with so\nmany people that I thought if I was ever\ngonna start a YouTube channel this would\nbe the first thing I'd be talking about\nand here we are\nhi everyone my name is James Chani and\nif you're going university or you're\nthinking of going to university or you\nare confused and you're unsure of what\nto do well you found the right video for\nyou because by the end of this I'm\nhoping to give you a very clear idea of\nwhat you may not be told about\nUniversity it will give you a good idea\nof whether you're gonna go into the\nright degree or whether that's the\ndegree for you to go in and just kind of\nit hopefully it will help you is what\nI'm trying to say I'm just doing in a\nreally long winded way it also may\nsurprise you that I don't think student\nphones are a big deal should be a big\ndeal at all\nconsiderations on whether you should go\nwithout further ado let's jump into it\n[Music]\nso we're kind of sold a script that you\ngo to school you get good grades and\nthen you go to university and then from\nuniversity you get your job I mean\nthere's nothing wrong with that and\nthere really isn't it's just\nuniversities have changed from what they\nused to be an honestly there would be no\nneed for this video had it been during\nmy parents time right in England for\nexample universities were funded by\ntaxation which is taxpayers would be\npaying for students to essentially go to\nuniversity so it would be free\nit sounds good doesn't it eighty ninety\neight tuition fees were introduced and\nit was based on your income it was about\nlike one thousand a year now in England\nit's about nine point two K a year and\nyou might think oh that's strange\nbecause if it was free before surely now\nit's so much more expensive less people\nwould be going but no and we'll cover\nwhy that is in just a moment everyone\nlooks it's just a thing to do right and\nthere's a lot of parental pressure trust\nme I've been there there's pressure from\nyou know your friends because all my\nfriends were going off to university is\nyou get a bit of FOMO it's like what am\nI gonna do cuz I'm stuck here with no\njob and people are gonna think are this\nguy's an idiot cuz he doesn't go you\nknow and universities really presented\nto you as this very neat package they\ncome into your sixth form or your high\nschool or you go to their open days and\nit's like oh look how great is the car\ncampus I've got all the people smiling\nand it's parties and it's fun and all of\nthis will change when you see University\nfor what it really is which is a\nbusiness a degree is a consumer product\nthat's what it is it's you are going to\nuniversity and you're exchanging your\nmoney or in this case you know someone\nelse's money is alone for this degree\nthis is the product that you're getting\nwhen you see universities as a business\nand you start to look at it from that\npoint of view\nyou're gonna start to see all the\nintentions behind what they're doing\n[Music]\nso the IFS in england has said that i\nthink they expect 83% of students to pay\nback their student loans in other words\nthere's an 83% chance that you're not\ngonna be able to pay back your student\nloan so what's going on in England you\nkind of are given loans for two\ndifferent things you're given loans to\npay off your tuition fees and you're\nalso given maintenance loans this is for\nessentially helping you live it's to pay\noff your rent food that kind of thing\nand that's sort of the amount you get\nfor your maintenance alone does depend\non your income it's important to note\nthat neither of these loans consider any\nmaterial for your course\nso like books lab equipment none of that\nis covered by those loans that's for you\nto pay for yourself and if you don't get\nenough of a maintenance loan they expect\nyour parents to kind of supplement that\nthat's important because some people's\nparents aren't going to do that which is\nreally unfortunate the average debt of a\ngraduate is about 36 grand but there's\nalso one little thing that will probably\nnot be a friend and that's called\ninterest so you've got your principal\nsum which is you know roughly 27 grand\nor there abouts and then you've also got\nthe maintenance loans on top of that so\nthat's 36 K on average then you've got\ninterest which is a percentage of that\ntotal sum and it's added on to the total\nsum because obviously whoever's loaned\nyou your money wants to make money from\nthat essentially people hear about all\nyou got to pay back this massive loan\nand they go oh by James hello you only\nhave to start paying that back when you\nearn about 25 K a year so as long as I'm\nnot earning that much I don't have to\npay it back that's not how interest\nworks if you're not paying it back the\ninterest is gonna keep adding on so the\nlonger you sort of stay at home you know\ndoing whatever you're doing the more the\ninterest in the debt is gonna continue\nto snowball and build up and build up\nand build up so it's not a safe thing\nthough just because they say oh you have\nto pay it back when you start earning\nthis amount so don't worry about it\nis not a safe you don't trust me you're\nstill gonna be a cure in debt all that\nbeing said student debt should not be\nyour biggest concern and let me explain\nwhy now in England you can choose how\nyou want to pay back your student loans\ndepending on the plan that you're gonna\ngo for and there's a similar plan in the\nUS but the most common one in England is\nyou pay nine percent of your income\nwhich is above the threshold to 25k year\nthat you're expected to earn a new pay\nnine percent of any money that goes\nabove that from the income that goes\ntowards repayment so let me give you an\nexample okay and I've got one written\ndown here so let's say you're earning\n40,000 a year so that's your income and\nabove the threshold that is fourteen\nthousand two hundred and eighty so nine\npercent of fourteen thousand two hundred\nand eighty is one thousand two hundred\nand eighty-five pounds a year which is\nroughly a hundred and seven pounds every\nmonth that you're paying towards\nrepayments for your student loan when\nyou've really low K it's not a long you\nneed to see kind of student loans is\nalmost just like an extra tax that you\nhave to pay because it will\nautomatically come off in England on\nyour income statement and once it's been\ntaken off it's been taken off on top of\nthat in England after thirty years your\nstudent loan gets written off so if you\ndon't pay that total some amount in that\ntime it gets written off anyway so in\nother words it shouldn't be your biggest\nconcern in fact if the only thing that's\nholding you back at the moment from\ngoing to university is you know bearing\nin mind you're going for a degree that\nyou really want to do and you should you\nneed to go university you need to get\nthat degree to get into that career and\nthe only thing that's holding you back\nare those student loans go just go also\nit's worth noting that there's an\nopportunity cost that 50k that you've\nnow spent towards repayment could have\nbeen used for putting down a deposit on\na house or yeah that's what I can think\nof\nthe point being you could have used that\nmoney for something else but chances are\nyou may not have made that money without\nthe degree in the first place the most\nimportant thing with student loans to\ntake away is that it's how the\nuniversity now perceives you so you're\nno longer just the student you are\nprofit you are a customer that is very\nimportant to know because it leads us on\nto the next part\n[Music]\nuniversities really have a marketing\nissue the Advertising Standards\nAuthority has already made complaints I\nremember seeing this towards\nuniversities and their marketing\nmaterial but here's the funny thing and\nyou may not know this but there was a\ncap on the amount of students the\nuniversity playing my cap was removed\nand now universities are open to let as\nmany students in as possible and the\nreason why that is huge is because now\nthere is a major competition between all\nof universities to get students through\nthe door this is why when I mentioned\nearlier on how does it make sense that\nwhen universities were free there were\nless graduates than there were today\nwhen it's far more expensive this is why\nbecause after all you are a customer and\nthey need more of you because you give\nthem the money in order to fund\neverything to university spend millions\non their marketing millions what's the\nproblem with all of this I mean so what\nthey're spending money millions to get\nus all in if you're telling me James I\ndon't have to worry about student loans\nwhat's the consequence well you're about\nto find out\nwhenever something is scarce and there's\nnot enough of it\nthere's it immediately has more value\nright whenever something is abundant\nthere's a lot of it it doesn't have as\nmuch value that is really important what\nwe're talking about now because in the\n70s and the 80s about I think was nine\nto nineteen percent of young British\nadults will go to university now the\nnumber is about 50% there's a lot more\ngraduates now that's where there's this\nhog there's this whole concern of what\nis called grade inflation going on at\nthe moment and that is essentially\npeople's grades being much higher than\nthey ever used to be and you might think\noh maybe it's just that students have\ngone smile well they did standardized\ntesting which is like IQ test and on\naverage it's remained about the same the\nintelligence of students going to\nuniversity has been about the same so\nwhy are grades increasing at the rate\nthey are\nwell the ofs which is the office for\nstudents doesn't learn over\nthree-quarters of what is considered\nthis grade inflation cannot be explained\nI think the amount of people that passed\nwith that pass now with a first or a 2:1\nis something ridiculous it I've got it\nhere 75% of students achieve one of the\ntwo top classifications which is a first\nor a to 175 percent\nthere's no differentiating so you kind\nof see where I'm getting at if there's\nso many graduates the value of a degree\nis no longer what it used to be\nhow employable are you now if you have a\ndegree I mean free up mist by saying if\nyou're looking to get into a specialized\nsubject you need a degree I if you're\nlooking to get into law if you're trying\nto be as you know a surgeon a specific\ntype of engineer you're gonna want a\ndegree there's\nit's very unlikely you can ever get into\nthose fields unless you start up your\nown business and did it yourself\nit's very unlikely you're gonna get into\nthose fields without the degree 58% of\nemployers rated work experience as the\nmost popular qualification among those\npresented they agree that the classes of\ndegrees tell an employer a very little\nabout person on that note my personal\nopinion on it is is this a degree can\nlook good on a CV and I think it can\ndefinitely get you a foot in the door\nbut that's about as far as it goes in\nyour interview they really want to know\nthey want to see whether you've got the\nresources that they're looking for\nbecause you can be trained in university\nbut you may not be the right person to\ntrain for a certain company depending on\nthe field that you're going into\nwith all that being said a degree can\nstill be valuable so then why didn't I\ngo\n[Music]\nas I said there's a lot of pressure from\nyour friends from family from society\nthey tell you you need to go University\nand then people pick the wrong degree or\nthey pick anything that they can get\ntheir hands on will they pick something\nthat they're not too sure about or they\npick something just for the fun of it\nwill they pick something because it's\none that parents told them that is the\nproblem this is a difficult one to talk\nabout because of the ages of like 18 19\n20 21 you can't really know what you\nwant to choose as a career you don't\nreally know what you want I don't even\nthink of you probably know what you want\nlike it's a very difficult thing to ask\nsomeone to do and it's this problem with\npeople choosing the wrong degree for a\nsubject that they shouldn't have just\ntake they shouldn't have taken people\ntake stuff just because yeah just\nbecause they they had to they were\nforced to kind of go into something\nright how do you solve this issue\ntake a gap year a gap here is like this\ngolden period after you finish high\nschool six form and before you go into\nuniversity a gap here is the golden\nperiod where you get this free time if\nyou so choose to have of kind of\nexploring what you want to do and your\nchoices and also get a break from you\nknow you've spent all of these years in\nin education so it's that little one\nyou're breaking take the gap here I\nthink of everybody that lasts for help\nin this video I think there was only one\nperson who was an exception but all of\nthem said I wish I'd taken together all\nof them for example up until the point\nwhere I kind of finish sixth form I\nalways wanted to be an actor right it\nwas the thing that I would tell\neverybody when I was I've been doing it\nsince I was a kid since I was a teenager\nup until this point and I auditioned to\ngo to drama school which is like\nUniversity but it's very much drama\nacting centered and I didn't get in and\nso I was basically putting a position\nwhere I was forced to take a gap year\nand thankfully I did because that gap\nyear really allowed me to reflect on\nwhat I wanted and gave me a much better\nsense of direction of what I wanted to\ndo which is why I ended up not basically\ngoing to university because I realized\nduring that gap year that I had a big\ninterest in business and\nentrepreneurship and I realized that I\ndidn't really want to take a degree I\nwanted to spend the three years that I\nwould have spent in uni instead getting\nsome real life experience and kind of\nwell things like this right like\nstarting up a YouTube channel starting\nup a business that I've got in the works\nat the moment in fact during that gap PA\nI started a business with a good friend\nof mine it was like a digital marketing\nagency\na crazy saturated market but we started\nout together we did it for about six to\neight months it was just us like cold\ncalling restaurant owners because that\nwas this all niche we were going towards\nbe corner on these restaurant owners\nwe'd be booking meetings with them we\nwould go in person and we try and pitch\nthese restaurant owners our services and\nman I learned so much doing that so so\nmuch doing that it wouldn't have been\npossible if I didn't a leg up here and\nif you're wondering okay what should I\neven do during that gap year well I'll\ngive you some hints right now you kind\nof want to start to like experiment just\nexperience different things and see like\nwhat you're more inclined towards and\nwhat you can potentially see yourself\ndoing as a career I don't even think one\nyear is enough to get a really good idea\nI genuinely don't but it's what you're\ngiven it's that golden period that\nyou're given in that time here's here's\nsome stuff you can do\nthe first thing you can do is read a\nbook or a few books and I know some of\nyou probably like rolling eyes groaning\nbut I think your books are so amazing\nfor helping you get an understanding of\ndifferent areas in your life I'm talking\nnonfiction by the way not fiction I mean\nI'm sure if you read Harry Potter of\nyour gap here you'd find enjoyable but I\ndon't know if it would tell you a lot\nabout what you wanted to do to study for\nuniversity or whether you wanted to go\nI'm talking more like nonfiction airing\nmore on the side of like business\nself-development that type of thing\nwhich is essentially what this channel\nis for remember to subscribe for example\none book that I read which was my\nabsolute favorite I'm gonna grab it now\nactually was this book which is the\nMillionaire Fastlane by MJ DeMarco I\nhate the title of this book I sweat a\nlot but it is this book completely\nchanged my perspective on money and\nbusiness entrepreneurship it really\nreally helped I read this during my gap\nyear and it was one of the reasons why I\ndecided not to go university because\nthis book really helped me understand\nwhat I wanted from life and why I wanted\nto get from it at least for the moment\nin this current point in time that's\njust one example that like reading books\nis a great great advantage it helps you\nget an understanding it can help you\nchange your mindset and kind of change\nthe way you think about certain things\nbut if you don't want to read there's\nother things you can do another thing I\nrecommend in a gap view is get a job I\nwas working at a cafe during my gap year\nnot for a long time but for about a\nmonth and a half I wish I had worked\nmore longer than that but during that\ngap year I was also like doing some\ncourses like studying for acting because\nI was still kind of deciding am i doing\nthis and I'm not doing this but getting\na job is really good again it's that\nsort of work experience and life\nexperience you'll understand what it's\nlike to work in a work environment\nwhether you know you're working at a\nsupermarket one\nor in a cafe or restaurant or maybe it\nis an office job that you've got game\nexperience is great like it can it can\nkind of help you again see what maybe or\nhow you feel with the whole structure of\na job and what this sort of dynamics of\na workplace is like another thing that\nyou can do is travel\neverybody goes traveling on the gap here\nit's like the thing that everyone does\nif you have the money for it go for it I\nthink traveling is something that I love\nand want to continue to do in the future\nand it can help you sort of get a sense\nfor maybe again what you're looking for\nwhat you want another thing is going to\nnetworking events\nwhich I know a lot of people kind of see\nnetworking events as always like\nchampagne and you're munching cheese and\nit's not like a lot of the networking\nevents you can go on websites like me up\ncomm there's also a forum on the other\nones there are other places if you just\ngoogle search networking events near me\nyou'll find them they they can be on\nanything they can be on like a business\nand real estate they can be like they\nhave like video game nights if that if\nyou're interested in that they have\ncreative writing stuff if you just have\na look you will see so many different\nevents in fact I've set myself a little\nchallenge for 2020 which is to go to one\nnetworking event every single week but\nthe point of it is really a networking\nevent is a very good way of kind of I\nlike to finger solve hacks the system\nright it allows you to meet people that\nyou wouldn't have normally have met in\nthat situation and it also pushes you\nout your comfort zone like a lot and\nthat's always a good thing like it's\nalways good to write to some degree to\nkind of push yourself to do something\nyou wouldn't have normally done there's\na few things you can do no gap here yeah\nyou got a lot of time trust me like your\ngap here is a lot of free time to try\nout a bunch of stuff by the end of that\nyou should have somewhat of a clearer\nunderstanding of what you want to get\ninto again I don't think a year is\nanywhere near enough to get that real\ndeep\nstanding now filly in university and\nyou're watching this video you probably\nrealize it's too late for the gap year\nbut what you can do I think to kind of\nmake the most of that opportunity is\nagain you can read books I always\nrecommend that I love reading so I just\nI say this for anything it's my advice\nfor anything but you can also network I\nthink network in in university is a\ngreat great although nobody in uni is\ngonna be like whoa you know like\nbillionaire millionaire maybe they're\nfrom way more families but there's a\ngood chance that those people that you\nmeet in university especially if it's a\nreally well-known University in US a\nhigh reputation University there's a\nchance that those people you meet aren't\ngoing to do great things in life and\nit's good to kind of know these people\nnot to use them but to kind of benefit\neach other I think you're you're kind of\ndoing yourself a real disservice if you\ndon't try and network and talk to as\nmany people in your classes or in in\nsocieties I recommend joining different\nsocieties in university you're doing\nyourself a disservice if you don't try\nand meet people there and make some good\nfriends really buddy do study yes\nthere's great inflation but I still\nmeans you've got you gotta put some work\nand you gotta get your you you go get\nthat degree at the end of the day so\nthat pretty much concludes this video I\nwas was quite nervous about doing this\nI've never done kind of ironic because I\nwanted to be an actor but I've never\ndone a lot of you know in front of the\nscreen type of acting and it's also a\nbit different when you're not really a\ncharacter in your sort of yourself but I\nhope you enjoyed the video I hope it\ngave you a good idea on whether you\nshould go to university and if you're in\nuniversity on the moment at the moment\nwhat to look out for and how to make the\nmost out of that please give the video a\nlike if you enjoyed it it does help a\nton especially with the YouTube\nalgorithm comment down below if there's\nanything you feel like I've missed or\nyou have any other questions or if\nyou've watched up to this point I know\nthis is a long video so please do let me\nknow down below hours\nto all of it and if you're interested in\nkind of business off development\npersonal finance that kind of niche I'm\nstill trying to figure out what I'm\ndoing here\nbut do subscribe because I've got some\nawesome stuff planned on the way and\nyeah I think that concludes today's\nvideo I hope you have a wonderful day\npeace my friends\n[Music]\n"
